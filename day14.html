      The way I thanked the cook, Ida, was kinda weird. I had a
      sentence ready to say. But I had forgotten about it, and Mani
      was pushing with time, she was pointing out that it was time to
      call the chef, since Aneesh was back, and I was sitting trying
      to remember what that sentece was, and I couldn't so eventually
      I just went. And it was bad, and I even didn't stand up, which I
      should have done. But it was not too bad. I will take a picture
      of it now. So I did and now I am back.</i>

      Walking safari was a total failure, not because of the safari
      per se being a failure, but because I was not part of it. I got
      woken up via radio at the last minute, and people wouldn't reply
      so I took my time and went from my tent to the meeting point,
      but it was too late. Aneesh came to look for me, but he could
      not even find my tent. So they all left. But the interesting
      story is this: Yesterday Mani started feeling sick. We had
      dinner. She had dinner. But it was a little hard an
      painful. Fever was there, she felt it. She went to sleep, I got
      my thermometer. Aneesh did not want me to take her
      temperature. But all the others did. They were in the other
      Bungalow (we had 3 bungalows, and one camp site) and they would
      have measured the temperature if I would have not. So I went
      into Mani's room. And she was sleeping deep, so deep that when I
      took her temperature she did no even wake up. The thermometer
      read 40&#176;C, which is very high. The next morning it was down
      to 38.5&#176;C approx. But Aneesh yesterday night agreed that he
      would wake up and not go to the safari to take care of Mani, but
      as things turned out, he did go. The reason probably was that
      Also Ravi felt sick, and Leena was sick already, although it was
      her birthday. So Aparna stayed back to take care of
      everyone. And I happened to be there too, so I helped too. Then
      they all got back.

      The afterenoon started. I went back to my tent to fix the 2
      holes I found in it. I also tried to patch up the hole in the
      therma-rest, that was caused by Kamal sitting on a papercutter and
      hence snapping it. Then we did a night safari, which was very
      cold, and kind of cool too. We saw 3 rhinos, white rhinos,
      actually. And then more of the usual, like giraffes, but also
      some african kangaroos, which are rabbits, I think, of some
      sort, but they hop like kangaroos.

      Ida Oieda was our cook at the safari lodge. She prepared a
      gourmet dinner. It was really delicous. So I asked if we could
      be introuduced to the chef, and we were. She came out, and after
      Aneesh got back, I cordially thanked her for the delicous
      dinner. I mean, it was the least thing I could do. The dinner was
      great, the service was great, even better than the service I got
      from really good high class restaurants in the rest of the
      world, and definetely better service than in the USA. And the
      whole meal for about 700 Zm$ which, at our exchange rate of
      120Zm$/1USD, it comes out to be abuot 7USD. Just insanely
      cheap. The rooms are a little more expensive, around 180USD/nite
      and 280USD for the suites.
