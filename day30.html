    <P>
      The day of yesterday was quite intersting. It started off quite mellow, very 
      much like my rest day at Masai Camp. I had some breakfast, then I had some 
      luch, I think, but stayed at the campall day. It was a good day to get 
      information, though. I asked Dougy (douglas, big guy who always complains about 
      things)and he gave me a little information about thiopia, but not much. Then 
      this beautiful young lady approached meand introduced herself as being 
      Beatrice, and haveing gone to Ethiopia last september. She told me that I will 
      most likely ot find any rides up to Ethipia, and that I should therefore start 
      planning to go alone. To take a bus to Isiolo, then o to the police station 
      there and ask about truck convoys, or rides, or what the best route to Ethiopia 
      would be. To me it sounds kind of dodgey (as Hugo would say), but even Val, 
      (Brandon, the woner of the camp, girlfriend) told me that it is definetely 
      possible to do.
    </P>
    <P>
      Speaking of Val makes me think of a funny anecdote: I told her I was going to 
      take the publi bus to Isiolo, and she told me that I do not want to take public 
      busses, as they are dodgey. This time, istead of giving the usual coseting 
      answer, I simply said that I had been on them already. That answer seemed to 
      make her re-evaluate her statement, as if she first thought that I ould easily 
      get nto trouble, because of not enough experince, but then reconsidered, maybe 
      inspired by the fact that I had tried the buses already. I don't know why 
      people here tell me that you do not want to do this, you should not do that. 
      But then, when I talk to others, they tell me that that is the best way: To do 
      that "that", that I was told not to do. But I am coming to believe that some 
      poeple say somethings because they think yuo might make good use of these 
      advices, but they might not apply. And it's upto you to figure out which 
      advices apply, and which do not. To figure out when somebody is talkig like a 
      wise man, if he/she really is wise, or just stubburn or egocentric.
    </P>
    <P>
      But back to Beatrice, and what she was suggesting to do. So then from Isiolo, I 
      can camp there until I find a ride to the city just north about 7 hours, and 
      then I would only be about another 8 hours from the border to Ethipia. From 
      there, I should be able to find buses to Addis Ababa. Then from there I can get 
      to the Eritrean border, but I don't know what the conditios are yet.
    </P>
    <P>
      So now what is left to do is get the Ethipian and Eritrean visas, get as much 
      info from the embassies as possible, buy a lonley planet guide (I saw the 
      Africa ona a shoestring that might be a good one for me), buy th bus tickets to 
      Isiolo and go.
    </P>
    <P>
      Later in the afternoon I met Oki, who worksfor "Rough Guides", a sort of a 
      lonely planet guide. So he is travelling around Kenya staying at all the lodges 
      where he needs to stay, and all paid by the company. He always gets good deals 
      from companies that want to be included in the guide. So we played this game 
      that Dougy foudn somewhere. Its called [I forget] and has 4 wholes on each 
      side, and a bunch of discs that look like checkers men. The rules that Dougy 
      plays are kind of like pool: you hit with the blue disc one of the black or 
      white men in the hope that the one of your colour will fall into a whole. then 
      there is a red man, that is played last.
    </P>
    <P>
      We played that for a while, Dougy, Oki and me. Then we decided to go to the 
      black cotton, Oki, David and me, that is. David is a civil Engineer and is 
      working on building a new container loading/storage station for Nairobi. he 
      lives in South Africa, but is originally from Australia. so we had a little 
      smoke in David's car as we were heading off to "The Black Cotton". Entrance 
      there is 250Ksh, and every drink is 100Ksh. There is a nice dance floor there, 
      with four big speakers incorporated into a cement structure that surrounds the 
      dance floor. Then all around the dance floor there are bars and tables. The DJ 
      sits in the "DJ Box", which is an elevated room that looks onto the dancing 
      floor. Oki was able to go see it, as Val took him there, but they preferred me 
      not to go in, as Val said that the DJ was kind of anal about people going in. I 
      was not offended at all, and was waiting outside the door at the top of the 
      narrow and shallow steps that led to the DJ box.
    </P>
    <P>
      The crowd at the black cotton is mixed in color, with many Muzungus. David 
      calls this crowd the "K.C.", the Kenyan Cowboys. People are not extremely 
      friendly: if you are with someone, and that someone bumps into somebody else, 
      you will not automatically be introduced. There were a few beatiful ladies, 
      many in groups too, and a large number boys and couples. I ran into Hugo, who 
      told me that I was too slow last night. At the end he admitted that the real 
      problem was that there was nobody that was willing to give me a ride back to 
      the camp site, so they eventually just decided to jet. This, of course, also 
      added to the fact that he was boig nice, while his buddies didn't really care 
      about showing me around at all. I think I like Hugo. He seems to be nice, and 
      pretty straight forward. He seems honest.
    </P>
    <P>
      After Hugo, I kept on walking around the club, just like I always do at night 
      clubs, buyig drinks, getting something to eat, and actually at the food stand, 
      just ouside of the club I met this young local couple. They were very nice and 
      I had a good chat with the girl, Anne, and I bought some wings, with some 
      mexican like spiccy salsa, which was pretty good. But just as I order, I 
      remember that David said he would give me a ride back, so I go back and look 
      for him to tell him that I am just outside, in case he wants to go, or wants to 
      tell me something. He tells me that he found me (or actually us, Oki and me, 
      since Oki stays at the same campsite too) a ride, this guy called Martin. So I 
      tell Martin that I am outside, in case he needs to tell me something, and they 
      start laughing, David and Martin, as if I was overly concerned about my ride 
      back. Them laughing scared me quite a bit, because I knew I was not too worried 
      about the ride back, since I was trusting David. Now the fact that they were 
      laughing and saying not to worry, that they wont leave for a while and that 
      Martin was going to come look for me beofre leaving, now that was kind of 
      wierd. I don't know what it meant, but as it turned out, Martin at about 4am 
      decided to leave, but shortly thereafter, some buddies of his arrived and he 
      decided he would stay longer. So Oki and I just took a taxi home and split it. 
      so now: what was all that "no worries" talk of Martin and David? Oki was right: 
      when he heard that Martin was wanting to stay longer, he thought it would be 
      safest to just leave instead of waiting. I defineltely agreed.
    </P>
    <P>
      At any rate, after my wings, I came back in, had a shot of tequila-boom-boom, 
      then sat at a table/bench facig away from the table towards the dance floor. 
      Then I catch wth the corner of my eye this guy I saw at the campsite earlier. 
      He looks like a guy I have met already, I don't know who, but I really like the 
      way he looks. I don't necessarilly think he is a good person, but I like his 
      image: relatively long hair, very curly and sticking up, borderline messy, with 
      a light black skin and huge eyes. Anyway, he sat with a guy just behind me, on 
      the other side of the table. So I turn around and start to get closer as to 
      initiate a conversation. Immediately he tells me to look the other way. So I do 
      but I see nothing interesting on the dfance floor, just people dancing. So I 
      turn again towards him, but again he tells me the same thing, to look the other 
      way. So I look again at the dance floor, again I notice nothing, but this time 
      I understand he does not want me to look at what he is doing. At first I 
      thought he was buying something. But now I am almost convinced that he was 
      actually selling something. When I ran into him later that night, I asked him 
      if he had gotten anything interesting. Without asking any further questions or 
      clarifications about the question, he sort of smiled and answered "No". He must 
      have being selling something. Oki tells me that he heard from somebody that he 
      is a dodgey character...
    </P>
    <P>
      That sums up the "black cotton" night. Our trip back to the camp site, had as 
      protagonist our taxi driver, who Oki called Mr. Bean or Charlie Chaplin. Mr. 
      Taxidriver infact, had quite a few problems: first, when we got into the car, 
      while removing the "taxi" sign that he had o the roof of the car he dropped 
      half of it, so I picked itup for him. Then the car would not start. Whe it 
      finally started, it stalled. Then it wouldn't even get any power any more. "ah, 
      the battery" he says, as he is trying to open his door, which does not open, 
      and only with great effort ad magistry and patience he was able to hold up the 
      lock pin, lift the door, and pull the handle from the outside, while at the 
      same time exert a constant force on the door towards the outside of the 
      vehicle, and, finally, pop the door open. Then he completed a short task under 
      the hood, came back in and the car started again. Off we went with the 
      windshield totally fogged up, and the wipers with no rubber and no high beams. 
      Visibility was very scarce. Mr. Taxidriver was not even able to avoid bumps on 
      the road, becuase he couldnt see far enough away.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then we stopped for gas, he put in the exact amount of gas he could buy wth our 
      fare, and said "There. That was all my money." So I added "Well at least you 
      have some gas noww, and can drive for a while", and I got to the conclusion 
      that these taxidrivers probably just give rides just to pay for their gas. When 
      the tank starts getting low, they stop, and try to find somebody to give a ride 
      to, sot that they can fill up the tank.
    </P>
    <P>
      When we got back, I chillled at Oki's room for a while, as we had a little to 
      smoke. And we started talking. And talking and talking. And he said some 
      things, like how he could or would never put himself in a position similar to 
      the one I put myself into. He asked me if I was a chicken. He pointed out the 
      problem I have with getting to the point. He actually got to that immediately. 
      I wonder if he is really referring to how I don't get to the main source of my 
      issue or it is something else, but he claims that life is too short not to be 
      straightforward. I told him that there is nothing that life is not long enough 
      for. I think what he is trying to say it that I open myself too much to 
      strangers, exposing my inners, and being vulnerable. My approach to this is 
      that, yes, this might very well be true, but I have to find out how people can 
      take advantage of my frankness and openness. And when somebody does, that 
      person, of course, will loose all my trust. Oh well. There was more to the 
      conversation but we were kind of out of it, so it was not to coherent neither.
