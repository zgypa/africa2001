      Shit's not looking good, man, not looking good. In terms of making it to the 
      States by Jeff's Birthday.

      So he comes to my door, I think, yeah. And we go to the US embassy together, he 
      gets his darn letter of recommandation, which is not a letter of 
      reccomandation, and we then go to the Sudan embassy, to drop it off. The guy is 
      still waiting for approval for my VISA, and I start to feel this VISA is not 
      going to happen. Then we go to the Djibuti Embassy where he picks up his 
      passport with a VISA already. And we start thinking and planning on what to do.

      He wants to see the north, the south, the east (of Ethiopia) and Djibouti. He 
      is thinking of going to Sudan too, but first to go south. I am thinking of 
      going with. him. We need to find two more people. Maybe the two guys that I 
      met, the guys from Berkeley, but no, they already left. Maybe the spanyards, 
      that Danial met at his hotel...
