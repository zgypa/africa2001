      After waking up and having some of my crazy Indian sandwiches, I
      decided to go meet the Muzungus (white people) that I saw on the
      train. I find a couple from the UK, Joe (she) and Dean (he),
      then quickly another girl, Lisa, who said was traveling with
      Lucy. Joe started traveling in February from the Philippines
      then went to Australia, then to Africa, where she met Dean in
      Johannesburg. Lisa and Lucy have been traveling together since
      January, and started from China, then Australia, and eventually
      Africa, where they met Joe and Dean.

      At first when I met the couple, I was like "oh shit. that's just
      the worse, 'cuz' couples are always pretty closed to themselves
      when they travel". Then I met Lisa and was very excited. She is
      a very happy girl. I showed them where the first class lounge
      was and they were happy to enjoy it, although they were in
      second class (no more tickets in first class for them).

      These first days were characterized by my surprise on how much
      noise the trains made when stopping and starting. My final
      conclusion was the mechanism between each wagon, which is not
      lubricated and thus makes a hell of a noise when compressing and
      expanding. Not only the noise, but the jerk too, since it would
      move all of a sudden.
