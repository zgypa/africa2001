    <h1>Day 73 - Khartoum, Sudan</h1>
    <h2>Sunday August 5<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

    <P>First I decided to go take care of registration. Once I got the
    and gave them the passsport and a photo, they asked me to go zerox
    the passport, but the zeroxing machine by the office didnt work,
    so I walked down the street a little, and found oe. Quality of
    copies was horrible. ThenI went back to the office, only to have
    them telll me that I needed a stamp from tha hotel I was stayig
    at. So I had to come all the way back at the sailing club, and ask
    for the stamp,which they, of course , din't have. Williams called
    the guuy from the boeard who had it, and said he would do the
    stamping from me today. That meant going to the office again
    tomorrow.</p>

<P>So off I went for the post office, to see if I could call the
AmericanExpress company and get my money back, the TC, taht
is. Finding teh telecomunications office was pretty wild already. but
it turned out to actually have a sign on the door, on the wrong dorr,
but there was a signn. And it wsa big to. There is no real
telecomunications here. A room with omputers in the back, probably
with internet access, sort of office in the front with a lday bya
adesk iwth a computer or two round her. All was dark. there was no
electicity. Some power failure. Thank god, or rather Allah, that th
telephone worked also without electricity. o fancy cabins, like in
Ethiopia. Just a tlephoe y a desk we all had to share. And no collect
calls. So I had to call AMEX in UK, and givr them the number and have
them call me back. Which they did, and all seemed to work OK. They
asked me abunch of questions, then they said that they would do
investigaitions to find out the seral numbers of the stolen checks,
and eventually They toldme to call back on monday or tuesday to see
what they were able to do. This took about 4 phone calls, as the line
kept being interrupted, we kept on getting disconnected. An obvious
problem with the local linees, as the disconnection would be
immeditaely and inevitably followed by a busy tone.

<P>Then I had somethig to eat just in front there. They have goodo
food here too.

<P>Then I dicded to go do internet, and I found this internet cafe'
who were chargin like 1.60/hourUsd and stauyed there for 2 hours. They
hooked me up with the server, so I could do ss without being blocked
out by the server. That was nice.

<P>Then off I went towards the bridge, the nile bridge, just about the
junction of the 2 iles, and on the way, i saw the Meridien hotel. I
stopped tehre to check what the internet prices were. When I was in
thre, I noiced that one of the mchines on the desk was runing
linux. Wha a good surprise. The price here is 200 dinar, a little bit
more than what I paid. So then I asked about the UNIX box, and it
turned out to be BSD, and their boss was a uNIX freek. I have to meet
him.

<P>On my way out I scanned the computes, and saw a whe lady: it was
kelly. She asked me if I had a mminute so we talked , and she told me
of these 3 germans, just like this semi leech I ran into ust before I
dd my internet had told me. The existed" I thought.  Then Kelly told
me abou ther adventure to get to Khartoun, ?Gosh I must say I was
really like to leave the day I left: it took then 3 days only to get
to Gedaref, while it took me only 14 hours. What crazy stories they
had to tell me. They shoul give me th a URL ofr them, in case they
interet ize them.

<P>I invited her for a tour on the bridge, but she refused sayit she
had to do some writing. So we ennded up having a dring at a bar next
door, a great mango juice.

<P>We parted, she told me wehre she was tayig, awhit the germans, andd
i hit the pharmacy to buy some stuff, fansidar, and bug cream, and
mefloquine. he pharmacist was tellig me how he starts to work at 8 in
the moring and doesnt' close till 1am . pretty rought schedule, I
thought.  He then invited me to come and stop b his place , the
pharmacy to talk another time. Ue wa making jokes all the time,a
making the cosutemers wait, and wondering why I would et so worried
about the cstuymers waiting...

<P>After briefly getting lost, I was able to work my way to the
Ambassador Hotel, were Kelly told me she was staying with the
Germans. And on the way I bought a recording walkman of some kind. a
cheap 26 dollar kind. wih ext mic. I hope it iwll nnot brake before I
finish theis trip. Then I finally got the the hotel, and met them
Germans, or, at least 2 of them.

<P>What a nite. It was good to meet the Germans, Johnny and , and... I
forget. The one guy talks a lot. As soon as I walked into the room, he
wasnt saying a word, but then he started and woulenot stop. and talked
he did . he wouldn't even let me talk. I don't know how long I can
stand him. I will see. in the meawhile, we aranged to meet tomorrow.

<P>I stayed in their room for a while, talking, then we went down
staris to have a shisha. It was good, but I felt somhow clogged, or
something, anddidn't enjoy smoking too much. Then weordered some
sudanese cheese, the famouse cheese mike was talking about. It was
good. A lot like pecorino. Actually, I think it was pecorino. The the
walk home from their hotel, the Amabbassador hotel, where everything
is very expensive, to my sailing club. It was a long walk, mabe 30
minutes or so, and I didn't see anyone on the street. and I man no
body. Only 2 securty guards in front of one government guilding, and 2
other in front of the other. I am pretty sure the first building is
actually where the president, or governor stays. It is very pretty.

<P>Buut the weather tonite is just great. This wind, and the moon and
sky, perfectly clear... That's what this ciy rejminds me with this
river around it: it reminds me of New Orleans. I don't think I am
trying to compare the Missisipi with the Nile, but I actually
oam. They are about the same width down here. Ormaybe the blue Nile is
a little wider. . What a peacful city. Certainly I can't say that the
nite life is similar to the one in NO. Here there is absolutely nobody
on thestreets at nite.

<P>Ahd the mosques: abslolutely great. I wat o go see one inside.
