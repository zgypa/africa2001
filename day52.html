   And we woke up at 5:30 or so, and we din't want to wake up at the
   suond of the alarm.  So I proposed a Red Bull, one of those Red
   Bulls I had all the way from Zambia, recognizing the fact that this
   was an emergency, although it didn't seem like it at first. In
   fact, I had already seen ahead: if we would have slept, we would
   have missed the mass ceremony, but we would have regretted it,
   because we wouldn't have really gotten too much sleep as the noise
   outside was getting louder and louder. So I proposed a Red Bull.

   And it got us up, if not for the caffeine it did just because we
   had to drink something and we were looking forward for the Red Bull
   taste.
  </P>
  <P>
   We met Mark, the guide, on the street and had him take us at the
   seven Olive hotel, since, by now, Dan really had to take a
   crap. And he wanted to use some decent facilites. So he took us
   there reluctantly, as he wanted to go to start the tour so we
   could catch the mass ceremony. In the meanwhile we saw where they
   would have us camp.  They showed us that we could camp on a safe
   little strip of grass. It looked appealing.  We were thinking about
   camping there, maybe, but nobody was at the reception yet, so we
   thought we would come ask around lunch time.
  </P>
  <P>
   Off we went for the Eastern Cluster of rock-hewn churces. We first
   had to buy the ticket. At the ticket office, Dan liked the
   sheppards stick of a local sheppard that was working at the ticket
   office, And he was about to buy it, but then thought about it
   again. He thoght about how he should wait until later, so he
   doesn't ahve to shlep it with him for the day.
  </P>
  <P>
   Well, the churhces are marvellous. The first one we could only see
   from outisde at first. A huge monolith, a huge piece of stone in
   the form of a church. Covered by a steel roof, to rpotect from the
   water. We waited outside and waited for the mass to be over, so I
   started to draw the church. Then we went inside and Dan did some
   recording of the singing and taped some video. At the end of the
   ceremony there was a tradition that they did, and it was to caress
   the followers with the 7 kg golden cross, the Lalibela Cross. Dan
   aksed me if I was religous, because he was saying that I should go
   get <i>crossed</i>. I didn't want to get crossed, but I
   thought, or it seemes that he was going to get crossed, and he
   did. And as soon as he did, he was illuminated and finally understood
   the meaning for religion, but not consciously, or realisticly, more
   emotionally. He understood why people were going to church, and why
   or how it felt to believe in God. But he was so overwhelmed, that he
   did not want to talk about it. So we proceeded. I was trying to draw
   the cross, but it was very hard, because the priest would not be
   holding it still.
  </P>
  <P>
   Lunch break. We decide to go check out another hotel, and move to
   it, since ours, the Kademnt, was not among the best ones. The Seven
   Olives seemed to be the solution, by pitching our tents there. This
   way we would pay only a few bucks a night and be able to use their
   great facilities. After bargaining the price down, we went to get
   our stuff from our old hotel. But on the way there, Dan said
   &quot;Why don't we check out the Private Roha as well?&quot; So I
   said &quot;Sure, why not?&quot; To tell you the truth, I was not
   interested in the Privare Roha. The idea of pitching my tent was so
   exciting, that I could not hope for anything better. But I didn't
   know what was going on in his mind. So we find it (it's kind of far
   down the hill in the centre of Town, according to Christmas, the
   kid that was our English translator there.) I must admit, the place
   did look cozy. You entered inside the gate, and would hit the
   bar/restaurant area. Then you could go out a door in the back, turn
   right, open a huge, sheat-metal door/gate, ascend a good 10 steps,
   and finally appear on this courtyeard of triangular shape, having
   rooms on all 3 sides. So basically the rooms were the fence of the
   place. At the one corner there were the steps, the other had
   showers, the last had the toilet.
  </P>

  <P>
   Dan seemed to like it. No, he seemed to like it a lot. Actually, he
   liked it so much, he would have rather stayed here, than at the
   Seven Olives. He made a point that his tent being crappy, would let
   water in and he would much rather not use it, especially in areas
   were it's rain-season. I gave in, and agreed to stay there. It was
   not easy, and it didn't just come like that. Also because I got
   annoyed at the fact that Dan wanted to make a decision then and
   there, and I wanted to make the decision while we walked to get our
   stuff. Maybe I should have brought this up, because I don't think
   it would have affected things too much. At any rate, eventually the
   decision got made by itself as I was not taking action. I was
   trying to pivot on the price, so after Dan got the price to be
   accedptable (i.e. what we would have paid at the Seven Olives,
   20birr each per night) I was asked for the money, and the
   commitment was made. So now I had decided if to bend my emeotions,
   or to split, at least only for the stay at Lalibela.
  </P>

  <P>
   The problem was that Dan was right: The Private Roha hotel is a lot
   better than the Seven Olives. It's homier, the pople are more
   friendly, to get to it you need to walk down this hill, for like
   500-600m, and it is pretty steep, through the mud of the village
   and the village people, the view of the room is on to the Eastern
   Cluster of rock-hewn churches, and, finally, the view of the
   crapper was on the other side of the valley: rooftop view of
   Lalibela. So I recognized this as being a spoiled behavior (that I
   preferred staying at Seven Olives) or maybe selfish or lazy, and I
   let it slide. And in fact it was perfectly all right.
  </P>

  <P>
   Then we proceeded to the next set of churches and saw those, which
   were marvellous. It was very rainy, and the stone was wet and
   slippery all over.
  </P>

      <!-- START CENSOR -->
      <P>
	It was great though. We smoked some more and went through this
	new set of churches, this time with noone around, and it was
	like being kids again and playing in an amazing playground. I
	mean, we are talking about huge, narrow tunnels, with nobody
	around, because it was afternoon and there were not many
	people there. Not many at all!
      </p>
      <!-- END CENSOR -->

  <P>
   What a memorable experience. An Italian guy, Carlo Molina, I met
   yesterday said that the churches would not be astonishing, but I
   think, and I firmly do, that they are. I mean these churches were
   dug out of the stone, for crying out loud. And according to the
   legend, they were done in very little time as well!
  </P>

  <P>
	At the end of this day, we contemplated the options. It turned
	out to be a good idea to stay another day in Lalibela, then
	see if we could fly from Aksum to Harar, then take the bus
	from Harar back to Addis. We had dinner at our hotel, took a
	shower (actually, Dan did, not me) a hot shower with water
	they boiled for us

	<!-- START CENSOR -->, had a little ganja<!-- END CENSOR -->

	and went to bed. <!-- START CENSOR -->Oh, yes, the ganja was
	possible because on our way back from the churches, Dan asked
	some kid for some Ganja, and the kid hooked us up with some
	real expensive shake: $5.95 for 8 small spliffs.<!-- END
