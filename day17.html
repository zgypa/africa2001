      We woke up at 5.30. We drove down to Marimba, just across the
      border in Zambia, to fly the Mircolight.I liked the Microlight
      experience. They are two seters: pilot and passenger. When I
      went up, the pilot showed me the falls from above, then he told
      me he was going to do some dives. so he did one. I got really
      scared. So he said "OK, don't worry, we wont do any of those any
      more". But I insisted that I wanted to do another one, since I
      was first getting used to them. So we did, and this time it was
      GREAT! I loved it. I was able to enjoy the dive fully and wanted
      him to do more, but he didn't. From there on, we looked at some
      animals, basically doing a Microlight safari. That was OK, but
      what I really wanted to do was more diving and playing with the
      aircraft. Oh well, I didn't push it enough, so he didn't do
      it. Other people, with the same pilot did a lot more of those.

      After everyone was done with the flying (and those who first
      didn't register for it they still did the 15 minutes flight
      instead of the 30mins. and they also did the helicopter ride...)
      we went to this other crazy expensive hotel with beautiful art,
      great pillows. It made me think of how cool it is to have so
      much man power for so cheap: you can make all these costum made
      objects, like all the furniture was hand made, and even little
      wooden things that would hold worchestershire sauce and tabasco
      and tomato sauce and mayo ro something, with the wholes that
      were exactly the samesize of the bottles themselves. Wow, what a
      hotel. Aneesh said the grand opening hadn't evenhappened
      yet. The hotel was called Zmabezi Sun, which is a chain of South
      African Hotels.

      Now we are in the bus heading towards home, that is Aneeshes
      home, the real kingdom, since Aneesh got elected king of the
      Vengans...
