	Day 50 - Hyke, Ethiopia
      </H1>
      <H2>
	Friday July 13<SUP>th</SUP>, 2001
      </H2>
      <P>
	Today is departure day. We wake up at 5:30 so to be at the
	train station by around 6am, and we look for a bus to
	Weldyia. And we find one. The price was 48 birr each.</p>

      <P>
	The bus leaves at around 8am. The way we enter the bus is by
	circling around it once. Not to mention that the circling
	around totally screwed up our positioning plan to get good
	seats. So we end up with basically no seats at all. Well we
	find them, but not even window seats, which are good for
	sleeping.</p>
      <P>
	Dani kept on complaining for this girl in front who was very
	cute and little, but would puke all the time, and take
	craps... a toddler. And would smell like a warthog. But nobody
	would open the window..</p>
      <P>
	The trip was not too exciting. We stopped at this little town
	for food, and we saw, actually, something that was pretty
	interesting. A kid who was begging. Right, you see those all
	over the place. But behind him there was another kid who was
	tapping on his shoulder and was telling him not to beg. Doing
	the &quot;nono&quot; finger and head shake. Dan noticed that
	at first.</p>
      <P>
	The sceneries were great. But I was complaining because we
	couldn't see too much of them since we didn't have window
	seats, and since everybody had the curtains pulled to reduce
	sunlight.</p>
      <P>
	At sunset, the bus stopped in a town which was not Weldyia,
	our final destination. We thought we would make it in one day
	to Weldyia, but in fact we did not. We stopped at Hyke, and
	stayed at the M. Hotel, just opened and unfinished about 1.5
	months ago. It was an OK hotel, and we had food there, it was
	not bad. Before the food we had some juices at a bar, with a
	local 8th grader. Great juices, those Ethiopians juices
	are. And the 8th grader was pretty cool too. He was pretty
	eager with learning English.</p>
      <P>
	Dani asked information about the new hotel we were staying at
	so he could send it to Phillip Briggs, his guide book.</p>
