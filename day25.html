      Wake up at about 9 in the morning, go down change some money, have coffee in a 
      bar, instant coffee, run into Christian. That's how the day all started. 
      Bumping into Christian, this rastafarian streetboy in Dar.

      Immediately he was trying to sell mea deal with the boat to zanziba. the deal 
      was: I give hime the nmoney, he goes up, knows the people gives them the money, 
      and then comes back to you with the tickets, at the residnets price, though. It 
      seemed like n unappealing thing to do just to start with. First of all, why 
      should I try to rip off this coutry that is trying to make a living out of 
      tourism , by helpig a bum, second of all, the math didn't even add up! He was 
      claiming he could get the tickets for 1500Tsh, but I had just checked, and the 
      local rates were 8500,so both ways would be 17000 and he would be asking me for 
      less money thanwhat he actuallyu needed, In addition, he was asking me to do 
      what? Gve him the money, and wait for him to come back with the tickets? Ueah 
      right. So instead I asked him for grass. Of course he could help me for that , 
      ad hooked me up with two spliffs. Then he took me to smoke by the water, after 
      having stopped and asked me to wait that he had to go pick something up Asked 
      me to to sit ect to hime, gave me two spliffs as a gift, Itook them, so not to 
      leavin the open and was trying to think on how that was not a good move, when a 
      cop cameand told me that he saw everything and to go in the car.there they told 
      me that Ihad to go to jailfor a day and taht the fine would ha ve been 3---USD. 
      then he started asking for money. and that's when he statrted and he was 
      yelling for more money threating meandI had to wip out thestash, since I did 
      not have/ was not prepared to have to wip out more than 20 usd out. or 50 or 
      so. and hekept onasking for more , and more, and when I got to a privateplace 
      and counted how much i HAD LOST I HAD GAVE HIM, IT WAS 890USD. NOT BAD, HE, FOR 
      A RASTAFARIAN.? THEY SAID HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO JAIL, BUT OF COURESE IT 
      WAS A NICE, CLEAR ObVIOUS SETUP.

      And this anectdote, of course, made me think a lot about how America has 
      spoiled me. In that it stopped my already started eduaction on how to cope with 
      the fact of not being able to trust or rather treat everybody equally. But at 
      that time , I was not happy to have to do it, and was trying to find a way out, 
      But now that I realize, that there realy does not seem to be a way out, I am 
      trying to be happy about the whole thing. I am still trying to decide whether 
      to even just look at people that approach you, or not even that

      This happened all just around noon, when I was supposed to take the ferry for 
      Zanzibar at 1pm. When I got back to the hotel, to get my stuff, it was 20 to 
      one and I left a message to the girs I had met the day bofore leaving my email 
      address. Apparently, they were out to make the phone call. the guy that took us 
      o the hotel the night bofore was also telling me that he saw the girls walking 
      on the street just about half an hourh earlier. When I ran into him on the 
      streets. So he probably was not llying. At any rate, I took a cab to the ferry, 
      then hopped on, and headed to Zanzibar.

      The ride was wet, as it started to rain. I met some french people, 2 guys, but 
      they were being french and not too social. Then I met 2 norvegians at the 
      immigration/tourist office. They were looking for a bus to go on the east coas 
      of the island. Iwanted tog et out of the city after all tha had happened to me. 
      I just felt like relaxing for a while, so I went with them, to this place were 
      they were renting bungalows just on the beach. I got a single, and they got a 
      room too.
    </P>
    <P>
      When I got in the bungalow, that's where I counted the damage, how much I had 
      given to the cop in the car. Then I went for a bath, but the low tide was 
      making it extremeley annoying and shallow, so I soon came out and headed for dinner.
    </P>

      Adam is a nice guy, he works here. He tells me I can go back to the city 
      tomorrow with him on the dala-dala, which he explains to me, means 
      5shilling-5shilling, sort of like nickel-nickel, because the bus used to cost 
      one nickel once, instead of 200Tsh, and so they called it nickel-nickel to 
      distinguish it from the plain ol' nickel.
    </P>
    <P>
      Dinner was fun too, as we had it all together, and we got a little drunk and 
      just kept on drinking and talking about norway, and politics, and WTO and IMF, 
      and I think I want to go to Norway for a while.
    </P>
    <P>
      I hung out on the beach, had a little to smoke, then went to bed.
