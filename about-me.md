## About Toni

Toni Magni is a biomedical engineer, focused on orthodontic software IT
infrastructures. Coming from a family of orthodontists (grandfather, father,
sister), he decided to use his skills primarily in the orthodontic domain.

Toni is fuelled by his passion for eliminating inefficiencies, specifically in
the medical profession, where software is often not capable of easily exchanging
data between each other. He considers himself a patiently hard working nerd
eager to create an infrastructure which software developers, doctors and
patients can use to fully take advantage of current and future technologies. 

Believing the involvement of the entire orthodontic community to be necessary in
order to succeed, his position as clinical instructor at the orthodontic
department at Case Western Reserve University, plays a key role. Teaching
student doctors about interoperability, then bringing these concepts into life
into the orthodontic practice, while at the same time collaborating with
associations and organizations ensures the engagement of the entire community.

Meanwhile at tops Software he vastly improved the productivity of his department
by developing and implementing software solutions and starting a research and
development group.

Toni believes mindfulness in the workspace is key to success, a tenet he lives
through his interest in meditation.

Toni is always interested in collaborating with others, since his projects are
often too big for him to complete alone. Reach out to
