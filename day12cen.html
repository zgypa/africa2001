      We are now on the bus heading towards Zimbabwe with a stop in Livingstone. 
      Yesterday, the six hour safari. It was very good, and we had that good tour 
      guide, Stan, that the other group was talking so well about. He was good, as a 
      matter of fact. We didn't get to see all the cool things they saw the day 
      before yesterday, but it was very good.

      I decided to go camping in the national park on our next stop. Being inside 
      life so much is good. I will need some advice, but I think it should be all 
      right. There is lots of life here. If somebody ever felt like they wanted to 
      live, they should come here and camp in the private camping, the one with no 
      facilities, just space. You can come here, and live with other animals. All of 
      them. All together.

      After we got back from the six hour safari, we decided to cook the chicken, so 
      we build a grill from scrap metal they had at the construction site near by (or 
      actually we were trying to build it, but we then all decided it will be best if 
      we let Chama, our driver, do it, since he was not letting go of the task. He 
      had to do it, so it was good he did it. we cooked and all was all right.

      After all the eating was over, a hippo was the main
      attraction. It was grazing under a spotlight in front of the
      restrooms. Everyone was enjoying its presence and making and
      taking pictures. Some people, like Aparna, more concerned than
      other.

      Then Vijhung came by. This was all because he was sleeping
      upstairs of the Belle, that is the boat house, which turned out
      to be The original Belle boat, used to bring tourists around the
      Chobe river in the 60's. Now, also Kamal was sleeping upstairs,
      and he decided to lock everybody in the room, as they were
      sleeping, which gave him a lot of power. So Vijhung was probably
      or felt probably responsable and came down to make sure all was
      all right. Then Kamal went to bed, Vijhung followed and so did
      I. Or so I thought. It was rough. At least the beginning
      was. First very loud Snoring from above and below. Then the
      sleeping bag was backwards, or I was backwards. Then I finally
      fell asleep, but I soon woke up for peeing. Outside was
      creepy. I felt like there were lots of creatures watching me. I
      think there was one hyppo just infrot of the Belle (or the
      Titanic, as Charma lilkes to call it) and a few on the other
      side of the bridge.

      Now we did the border which was a trip. First we went to the Botswana-Zambia 
      border to get nto Zimbabwe, becuase on the way int the immigration guy told 
      Aneesh that he had to bring the customs forms back to that border. He was a 
      little confused but did it. Thenit turned out that after we all got our 
      passports stamped, we needed to go to the other border, the Botswana-Zimbabwe 
      one. Which overall makes more sense. So we did the the first Botswana border, 
      then the second Botswana border and finally the Zimbabwe border. I paid 30USD 
      for my single entry tourist VISA.
