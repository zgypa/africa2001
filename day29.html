      Day 29 - Nairobi, Kenya

    <P>
      So I wake up with the noise of the big group packing up and leaving. I am lazy, 
      so I roll aroud for a while, then wake up, do some clenaing around and 
      morning-tent-organizing, and then by the time I walk out of the tent, the big 
      english group had already left.
    </P>
    <P>
      I start packing up my tent, under the raind, and my stuff, while still in the 
      tent, then I go out in a moment of non rain. Thi intermttant Tanzanian rain. I 
      notce a tent , a new one, iwht a mororcycle next to it, and I meet the owner, 
      who had also just gotten out of his tent. He is from south Africa and is 
      travelling south I belive. but he told me that there were about 6 people from 
      the big group that wsa gong bak to Nairobi, and that I probably could have 
      gotten a ride with them. But theywere going on a shuttle anyway, so whatever
    </P>
    <P>
      He seemes to be preparing to leave, so I ask if I an get a ride to tow. he 
      agrees, agives me a helmet, and tries to start the motorcycle, which doesn not 
      start. So he telles me to start walking, that we will chekc the sparkplug to 
      see fi he can fix the prbolem, that seemes to be new. So I started walking, and 
      after about 5-10minutes I find in front of a Matatu bus askig if I wanted a 
      ride. I asked if they were going downtown, and hopped on. the ride was 150Tsh. 
      not bad.
    </P>
    <P>
      Now I just had to follow the planb I had prepared the day before, so I went to 
      change some money, then I went to the telephone house, to call Adam and home. 
      The procedure there is operator asisted: you write on a piece of paper the 
      number you want to call, the lady operator make the call and tells you to what 
      cabin she will connect you to.Then you go in the cabin, pick up the phone, and 
      she waits until the other side picks up, then starts here CASIO digital 
      stopwatchfor the duratin of the call.
    </P>
    <P>
      I called Adam. He didn't seem to be too excited that I called.; I don't konw 
      why. Maybe he was but I could not tell. At any rate, I told him I would have 
      called him from arusha, and I did.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then I went to exchange money again, to a new place, because I wanted to buy 
      some Ksh (Kenian shiling) and I even decided to go back to the first place, 
      because the rates there were a lot lower.So I did, and on the way back, i met 
      another street guy, that said that his brother worked at Riverside, the shuttle 
      I was planning in taking, that I had heard was very good. And he took me there. 
      I bought a ticket, left my back there, and followed the guy, whose name I 
      forget ( I bleive its Ibrahim), to the internet cafe', where I did some of that.
    </P>
    <P>
      Ibrahim wated outsie. Then I had something to eat, and Ibrahim started talkig 
      to me about girls and drinking and bars. First he said to pay attentino in 
      Nairobi at bars for people putting stuff in your drinks. He told me the story 
      of the Japanese guy.
    </P>
    <P>
      The ride to Nairobi started perfectly on time and was pretty smooth. I really 
      enjoyed all the landscapes. When we stopped at the border, the ladies, of some 
      tribe, I don't know if they were masai ornot, but they were very insisting. and 
      sticking stuff inmy face. But some ladies understood what I was saying or that 
      I did not want and respected that and pulled back smiling. Others did not. but 
      a lot of them had big big peircing or stretching f earlobes.
    </P>
    <P>
      The second half of the ride was a little bit more social. AT any rate I got to 
      Nairobi, and to the Nairobi Park Services camp site, since I could not get to 
      the other one, suggested by theguy at the bar at the Masai camp site. I twas 
      called something like Appeil. The taxi driver, recoomended by the shuttle 
      driver ripped me off by asking n=me for 2000Ksh instead of about 1000. Bt tgis 
      camp site is OK, so I stayed and met some people wile sitting at the bar. 
      Theese are white locals, and they told me how they had no idea wabout 
      Etghhippia and who to ask. Then they were goijg some place, and one of them 
      asked me if I wanted to go. I said yes, then he asked members of the group if I 
      could come along. they did not seem to be to excited about the idea, but 
      eventually they agreed and told me to come along.
    </P>
    <P>
      And I told them I had to drop off some oney and exchange some, so I went and 
      did it, and by the time I was done, they were gone. what a shame. I would have 
      liked to go and do some Nairobi night life. So after hat I really did not do 
      much but talk to Smiley, a auto electrician that works here. He is also the 
      local taxi service.
    </P>
    <P>
      At somet ime along the night I found my self on a hand made long chair, 
      pondering about how there are different types of learning methods. You can 
      learnd something just by hearing about it, without needing to live it. That is 
      really good. Or you can learn someting or rather you might need to live to 
      believe, and then once you have experined, then you understand better. adn 
      learn. but you then learn the whole field, not just that one thing. So, fyou 
      get screwed once, then you sor t of learn how not to get screwed any more . But 
      then there is also a stage wehre you have to get screwed for all different 
      things, like getting robbed, falling into a trap, or getting mugged. There is a 
      astage where youhave to learn everything or you will notknow how to do it. And 
      that is pretty bad alreaedy. Then there is the worse stage, or class of 
      peo[ple,P those who never learn. No matter what happens or how often. I think I 
      fall in to the second category.
    </P>
    <P>
      So I just brushed my teeth, then cleaned some grass from stems and seeds, and 
      smoked a little and went to sleep.
