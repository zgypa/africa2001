      Day 27 - Arusha, Tanzania

    <P>
      Not to much sleep on the boat. Not really. At 6am we had already arrived, adn 
      since we went to bed late, we didn't really get too much sleep. Leaving the 
      boat was interesting: on the way out I ran into the kids that I hung out with 
      in the VIP lounge, and they helped me out too: they offered me a cu pof coffe 
      for 50Tsh on the street by the port, then walked me to the dala-dala and paid 
      the guy 100Tsh to go to Ubungo, where the bus station for Arusha was. At the 
      dala-dala bus stop, a bunch of people approach me, and a cop is there to. I 
      tell my problem to him, he talkes to the kids, tells me to follow him, and as 
      he gouse away, he pulls with him the storm of kids trying to convince him to be 
      elected. He is fairly quiet and at last turns around towards me, and says: 
      "This one: follow this guy here". So I did. And he took me straight to the 
      ticketing office, were they were asking me for 40,000Tsh, but seemed to be 
      happy when I gave them only 20USD. I boarded the bus, it was 7:20am, and the 
      bus left at 9:20am, instead of 8am.
    </P>
    <P>
      The bus ride was pretty intersting. The most painful part was the beginning 
      sittingn for 2 hours in the bus with no air, or very little of it, and heat. 
      But once they got going, things changed a little. It was airyer. It was a very 
      long trip though: 580km, 10hours whih makes average cruise veloity 58km/h, much 
      faster than the 33km/h of the train.
    </P>
    <P>
      Towards the end I met Zumbezi, orsomething like that ( i wrote the name on my 
      hand, so I would not forget, but then before I worte it down for real, I had to 
      wash my hands with dish washing detergant (in order to ea, I didn't have soap, 
      they didn't, so they just gave me the dish detergent, in powder) so it was all 
      gone), who made me get off at a big hotel, came with me, showed me wereh to 
      change money, hoocked my up with a campsite and a TAXI driver, then sneaked a 
      ride with me on it.
    </P>
    <P>
      And that is how I got where I am now, at the Masai Camp ($3/nite). Which opens 
      a whole new Masai world. See, the Masai is a tribe here, one of the only tribes 
      to have maitnined theyir tradion. They are the tribe that people always talk 
      about the one where they circumcise at theage of 12 with a knife and no pain 
      killer, and the boy has to smile during the operation, and theydo the same for 
      the woman where they ut off the clitoris, so they dont' t want to fuck as much. 
      Cuz what happened was that once the men had to go away for a big fight or hunt. 
      They stayed away a long time, maybe about one year. And when they got back, 
      many wives had children or were pregnatn from somebody else. The wives 
      explained that they were doing it just for sex, not to betray the husband. So 
      as a way to stop that, they decided to rejmove theyir clitoris.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then, also, if you are not home, and I am yur friend, then I can come into your 
      house, and if your wife is there, I can stick my dagger on the door, put my hat 
      on it, and fuck your wife. If you come home, and see the aht, you have to wait 
      outside, until they are done. And this same tribe lives with cattles and does 
      not farm, but only eats meat and cheese,they dress funy and always have a stick 
      and are veryskinny,. They kind of remidn me of samurai.. And they remind me too 
      of the american equivalent, the Amish peple, because the Masai also don't use 
      technology and like to move from one place to the other and have their dress code.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then I met a couple of canadians, who had just climbed the kilimanjaro
    </P>
    <P>
      Then I talked to the bartender, Adolf, and then to Joseph, a jut taht was 
      working here and sitting at the har chatting away. then I startedtaling to 
      Jospeh, and it started with politics, then if finally got to Ohm's law, for 
      some reason as wer were tryig to calculate or to see how to calculate how to 
      warm up the windhsiled of a ar with a resistance. Then that took us it 
      incandescent light bulbs, and Neon light, then the came back 
      tothermodynamicsdiscusing how you ca defrost the windshieldalso ny sing a/c 
      instead of hot air.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then Adolf hooked me up by asking Isaac for some grass, and Isaac, security 
      Masai guy, gave me 5 rolls of packed stuff. which i promptlypu in my hat and on 
      my head. And that night ended pretty much like that. We then went to bed and I 
      slept in my tent.
