    <h1>Day 76 - Khartoum, Sudan</h1>
<h2>Wednesday August 8<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

    <p>The Germans got their money and their tickets. Uli finally
    decided to go wi th them to Greece, and not come with me to
    Egypt. Then I invited them over my pl ace at around 6pm, since
    Steve was supposed to come at that time with the Ganja.  Uli also
    gave me 2 books: Reise Nach ixtlan (Carlos Castaneda) and And
    African Student in China (E. John Hevi)

<P><95> At 6pm I got stood up by the Germans and by Steve, of
course. I was not too surprised: Steve, well, I was kinda
disappointed. After all I believed him, and he took me to his friends
place in this village last nite and helped me out a l ot... But that's
why I only gave him 500SD: I thought "Well, if we doesn't show up at
all, he can take the money as a tip for helping me out, which he
did. It's an expensive tip, but it's worth the risk". As far as the
germans go, well, I h ad to expect they wouldnt' show up. They are a
bunch of kids.

<P><95> find pipes in egypt in Hesseini near/opposite Al-essar

<P><95> Sharia 15 : Freeway (Mikee)is cheeper, Al-Haui

<P><95> Another good drink is the "Shair", which is kind of white,
made out of some barley, or weat, I think its barley, though, since he
said it's what you make b eer out of.

<P><95> Dinner was at this restaruant that the two Swiss that arrived
yesterday new about. We drove their iwth their Nissan Patrol. They
couldn't find it, then the y got lost. And on the search for the
original street, we bumbed into the restau rant. I knew, when they
said they couldn't find it, that we were going to find i t like
that. The food was good but they charged us way too much. I didn't
even t hink of debating the price. I ended up paying 700SD, which is
like 2.8USD.

<P><95> Just before going to bed, the guys, owners of some boats here,
offered me a spliff. It was a miracle, since here it is very illegal:
you get wipped 45 time s in public if you get caught with it. If you
get caught having sex it's 80 time s on the back (always
publicly). then you pay a fine, and are released.
