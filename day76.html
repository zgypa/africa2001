    <h1>Day 76 - Khartoum, Sudan</h1>
    <h2>Wednesday August 8<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

    <p>The Germans got their money and their tickets. Uli finally decided to go with them to Greece, and not come with me to Egypt. Then I invited them over my pl ace at around 6pm, since Steve was supposed to come at that time with the ganja. Uli also gave
        me 2 books: Reise Nach Ixtlan (Carlos Castaneda) and And African Student in China (E. John Hevi)</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            At 6pm I got stood up by the Germans and by Steve, of course. I was not too surprised: Steve, well, I was kinda disappointed. After all I believed him and he took me to his friend's place in this village last night and helped me out a lot... But that's
            why I only gave him 500SD: I thought "Well, if we doesn't show up at all, he can take the money as a tip for helping me out, which he did. It's an expensive tip, but it's worth the risk". As far as the germans go, well, I had to expect they
            wouldn't' show up. They are a bunch of kids.
        </li>

        <li> find pipes in egypt in Hesseini near/opposite Al-essar</li>

        <li> Sharia 15 : Freeway (Mikee)is cheeper, Al-Haui</li>

        <li> Another good drink is the "Shair", which is kind of white, made out of some barley, or wheat, I think it's barley, though, since he said it's what you make beer out of.</li>

        <li> Dinner was at this restaurant that the two Swiss that arrived yesterday knew about. We drove their with their Nissan Patrol. They couldn't find it, then they got lost. And on the search for the original street, we bumped into the restaurant. I
            knew, when they said they couldn't find it, that we were going to find it like that. The food was good but they charged us way too much. I didn't even think of debating the price. I ended up paying 700SD, which is like 2.8USD.</li>

        <li>Just before going to bed, the guys, owners of some boats here, offered me a spliff. It was a miracle, since here it is very illegal: you get whipped 45 times in public if you get caught with it. If you get caught having sex it's 80 times on the
            back (always publicly). Then you pay a fine, and are released.</li>
