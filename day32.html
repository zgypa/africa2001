      Day 32 - Nairobi,Kenya
    </H1>
    <H2>
      Monday June 25<SUP>th</SUP>, 2001
    </H2>
    <P>
      I decided to change campsite, as the Nairobi Park Services was too far awy from 
      the city, and I had to get some stuff done. So I went with Oki and Smiley in 
      the morning downtown: Oki went for his Safari, to Masaai-Mara, and I got 
      dropped off at the backpackers hostel (
      <A HREF="http://www.nairobibackpackers.com">
        www.nairobibackpackers.com
      </A>
      ), were Steve, the owner, is very cynical, but mainly sarcastic. This is one of 
      the main reasons why Oki does not like him. I think he is OK, and yes, very 
      sarcastic all the time, but not always, and there are moments were he is not. 
      Nonetheless, maybe Oki is right, not to trusts him.
    </P>
    <P>
      This campsite is like 15 minutes walk from downtown, and 10mins fron the 
      Ethipian embassy. Being finally Monday, I go in the morning to drop off my 
      passport and $70 at their embassy. Then I proceed for downtown with Martin, a 
      high school student from Suda. He told me that in Sudan the situation is not 
      too good, but it iw not to dangerious neither. What I should watch out for is 
      the southern part, at the border: he strongly suggestted me not to cross the 
      border Sudan/Ethipia via Land. but to Fly into Karthoum from Addis Ababa instead.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then he told me that if I want to go to Ethiopia, I need to go to Islee (which 
      then turned out to be Eastleigh) and take a truck there. And he asked if I 
      wanted to go there. I must remmeber that I as soon as I ran into him, just 
      outside the embassy, I told him I could not fgive him any oney. and he said it 
      was all right. So he took me to the bus stop, we hopped on the bus, I paid the 
      $0.50 cents fair for both of us, and we went to Eastleigh. This is a dodgey 
      Ethipian neighbourhood, but after some askig, we finally aoud out that I can 
      leave for Moyale from there by showing up around noon and hopping on a truck: 
      1000Ksh to sit in the cabin, and Ksh500 to sit ion the truck with the 
      cargo.Then we cam back to downtown, and had lunch, and then he had to go back 
      to school, since he only was allowed to skip school in the moring to go goet 
      his passport stuff done.
    </P>
    <P>
      So I concluded my Nairobi dive by going to an internet cafe', installing 
      winzip, teraterm and ttssh, and doing all my stuff. www.brillig.org is stil 
      down. I don't kow what is happening. Also acdt told me in an old email that I 
      had yet not read that he had still not recieved my money, which kind of worries 
      me.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then I went to this other place,, were Maritn took me earlier, for 
      international calls: they only charge 100Ksh/min istead of 200. So I wnt there 
      around 3pm and calle Jeff at 7912657. But beig there an 8 hours difference, it 
      was bout 7am for him, and nobody picked up the phone. I left a message. This 
      was kind of disappointing since I was exppecting him to be home, or at least to 
      pick up the phone.
    </P>
    <P>
      Whatever. I walked back to the hostel, where I met 3 girls, that had just 
      finished a tour from Cape town: one from GB, and 2 from Australia, that were 
      going to GB to workor study. A fourth girl was bing very asocial and reading 
      her book i a conrer.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then it was dinner tme, and as I was eating the fried fish with chips with one 
      of the girls, I saw 2 guys go back with backpacks: they turneed out to bo Yaron 
      and Yani, the Israeli brothers. They took showers, then, as I was just done 
      eating, they were going down the street to this place called Buffalo Bill's to 
      have soemthing to eat and they asked me if I wnated to go. I had to finish my 
      ber, so I did, and then we wet. They had soething to eat, and I had a shot of 
      whisky, which was supposed to cost like Ksh250 but the waiter screwed up and 
      gave me 2 shots, without me knowing it.So when the bill came, it was a problem, 
      because I had already drunk the whisky, and I didn't want to pay for Ksh500. 
      but at theend I apid 350, and he was goig to put the other 150. I think I did 
      the right thing: After all I didi drink two shots, and he should pay something, 
      or rather most of the extra shot, since it was him who screwed up by teling me 
      that the whisky would have been 250. So this way, I payed a little and he payed 
      most of it, as to pay for his mistake. Ad I got two shots for a better price 
      this way.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then the Israeli borthers,went to change some money at the hotel next door, and 
      we came bak at Buffalo Bill's bar, called the horsewhoe bar, to play some pool. 
      As it turned out, the bar was a whore bar, and the pool table had a waiting 
      list of 13 people. So we hung out htere for a little bit, I got some attention 
      from some laides, and then we all left. Actually, a funny anecdote happened:P 
      as we signed up for pool, we were standing just by it, and dind't realize that 
      we were actually obstructing the view of the pool table to a man dressed up in 
      a suite. So the man told Yaron: "What makes you think that I actually want you 
      to stand there?" And the girl with him agreed. I was like "Wooohhha" In my mind 
      and headed towards the door where I hung out with the door man for a while and 
      told him about the arrogance of the manin the suite. he knew the man, and he 
      pointed out that he has problems: men who are always alone (and in fact he was 
      alone, just with the girl) must have problems. So I went back in and enjoyed 
      the crowd and the beautiful ladies wantig to give me massages. I refused: ti 
      would be too much for the first night, and plus I had compay waiting outsied.
    </P>
    <P>
      So we came back, and hat's when Yaron and Yaniv actually put their 
      crediblity/reliability to a strong test: Whe we came back, steve was doing some 
      accountancy work on the computer and was already tiredand ready to go to sleep. 
      The two brothers approached him askig him were they could by some woodedn 
      carving curios. So Steve tarted tos how them s few places o the map.Ad since 
      this was taking a long time, I went outside to look at the stars ad smoke a 
      little. Wjhen I left, Steve had told them about 2 places and whoed them how to 
      get their with a map. When I came back, the brothers were still there, but this 
      time Stve had showed them more places, and had also revolutioized the way he 
      was giving directions: he wipped out some postcards of Nairobi and was showoing 
      them where the shops were on the postcards! Eventually Steve got fed up ad 
      "come on guys, let me finsih up here". As a matter of fact, they were able to 
      have Steve procratinate fora good 45 miiuntes while tired. Whe they came into 
      my room, Itold them "Banita, banita!", as theiy built upon their 
      credibility/reliability level.
