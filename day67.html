    <h1>Day 67 - Gondar, Ethiopia</h1>
    <h2>Monday July 30<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

    <P>In the beginning its all marvellous but after a while one gets
    accostumed to the scenery.</p>

    <P>Today is day 2 on the Cacciamali IVECO bus. It is pretty
    fast, but still the roads don't allow it to go to fast. Tarmac is
    worse than dirt roads, unless they are perfectly maintained. The
    holes that form on the asphalt.... just terribele.</p>

    <P>Wake @ 4:45 bus leaves at 5am. Get to Bahar Dar at 9:15 and
    to Gondar at 2:45. The second part of the trip, Bahar Dar-Gondar
    was the most enjoyful, as I was stoned and I had a book to read,
    the Italo Calvino book. I got very absorbed in it. I almost
    finished it.</p>

    <P>A big rock, like a monolith or a statue, was shooting up
    against the sky with a horseshoe of land around it, as it was
    looking down to the valley, in way a king may look at its
    empire.</p>

    <P>Arrive in Gondar and do email. Dan found an internet place,
    thanks to a guide. I went down there, and it seems that the
    changes I have made, i.e. transferring the page of Luigi over to
    brillig, worked perfectly. And smoothly. Could not do email, or
    log in with ssh, becasue the connection was too slow: it would
    have taken 2h to download teraterm.</p>

    <P>My insect bites still itch tremendously. I am suffering a lot
    for them. They never stop itching, and there is so many, it's
    almost impossible not to scratch them. They even scratch
    themselves, like when you are walking on the bus or so.</p>

    <P>It looks liek we will be able to get a bus to Metema tomorrow
    morning at 6am.  The busses suck here, but I must say that I am
    happy that they at least leave every day.</p>

    <P>I picked up a silly book, Tess Stimpson: pole position (38EB);
    and a candle for 1EB</p>

    <P>23:51 at our hotel: 2 shots and girl scream. I wake up, and rationalize
    danger. Dan didn't do a sound. It seemed like I had to say "what
    the fuck was that" in order for him to realize. I wonder. So I put
    my boots on. But it was nothing. I just went back to sleep with my
    boots on, so I didn't have to worry about escaping. That was
    enough to put me back to sleep.</p>
