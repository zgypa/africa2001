    <h1>Day 70 - Qalabit, Sudan</h1>
    <h2>Thursday August 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2001</h2>

    <P>I just finished scraping off dried mud off my pants, just so I
    could get into the tent and type, and there is this really loud
    noise of donkeys and sheep that sound like they are fucking, but
    the problem is that there is only one female donkey in the area
    here.</p>

    <P>I got into Sudan this morning I was really happy. I had to take
    care of some business first, especially I had to get rid of the
    weed I had left over before going through costums. For that I
    threw one lump away in the river, that I had imn my pocket, and
    the other I had to tell them the toilet story, and they believed
    me, so I went to the toilet and dumped it there. Other than that,
    the exit from Ethiopia was quite exciting: First immigration
    Ethiopia (the guy was about to not see my extended VISA and was
    about to give me some shit for it). In a hut, of course, or
    actually a mud house or hut. In metema there is no city: it's just
    a village, really. Then I cross the border on foot with
    Megnistaeb, who was still with me. First office is a police
    station, of some sort. They write me up in a notebook [There are
    now 2 little birds just about 2 feet from me, since they can't see
    me and are thus not scared. I am infact in the tent with the
    flysheet open, and mosquito net closed, so I can see them, but
    they can't see me] and tell me to go to costums. I do the costums
    thing (preceded by the fake crap) where they write me up in
    another, different book, always spelling my name in arabic. Then
    they take me to another office, I mean mudhut that is, which is
    supposed to be immigration, but it is yet another police or
    control station. They write me up in another book, and that's
    three by now. Finally, after waiting in there and chatting (it
    seemed like they wanted to have me hang out with them for a while
    so I haave a smoked a cigarette with them) I finally get to head
    towards the immigration office. Here I get written up in a book and
    get 3 stamps (finally) in my passport. Apparently I don't need to
    get the travel permits, or so they say, until I hit Khartoum at
    least.</p>

    <P>I am happy to be here in Sudan, as much as I am happy to have
    left Ethiopia, also if the country has given me lots of good
    things. After all it cured me fromm Kenya's Pneumonia, it got me
    to meet some cool Italians in Moyale, Dan, Lalibela, Aksum, Gondar,
    more fu in Addis, and finally the ride on the Russian truck. But
    the urge to leave was getting to big. I have to get back home, and
    the long stay in Addis has really reinforced this feeling in
    me.</p>


    <P>I feel this now too, that I am stuck here in Qualabit, because
    of rain. No rucks or vehicles left for Gedaref today. Nor have
    they, apparently, for the past 3 days. There is a long line of
    trucks here that want to leave but no traveller. Only me. I found
    some cool guy, who has some merchandise and has hired a truck with
    driver to take it to Gedaref for him. He was going to take me up
    in his truck. But then I heard of some Land Cruiser leaving
    tomorrow mornign at 8am. I am going to try to jump on that. After
    all I am missing a trip in a Land Cruiser, since the one in Aksum
    didn't really count, as it was more of an organizeed thing.</p>

    <P>But as I was saying, I like Sudan already. The people seem nice,
    there are not too many leeches (the only one I have got was from
    Ethiopia), they don't have Injera (hurray! I couldn't stand it any
    longer, especially after throwing it up in the bus ride to
    Gondar), they have good bread, spiced coffee, a drink called ... I
    fogrot already, but it's soft drink, like Fanta, but it's Apple
    flavored, and most important of all, they have the <i>shisha</i> all over
    the place. Today I had one already. It was delicous. Apparently
    they import them here from Egypt. What a marvellous place.</p>


    <P>Tonite I am staying atthe immigration place in my tent.</p>

    <P>Went out for some change and found old man, the wise man of
    the village. We talked all nite. Offered me a drink (that apple
    drink) and took me for some good food (benz, beans with garlic and
    more).</p>

    <P>Thought about Dan & Jeff.</p>
