    <h1>Day 86 - Eilat, Israel</h1>
<h2>Saturday August 18<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

<P>• I think I keep thinking ahead. I actaully do. I always look
forward for the future, and don't enjoy the present. Especially in
this trip, now that I have reached Israel. But partially it's becvause
of Guy. He is here, but with the girl, he is different. Not that I can
blame him. Who isn't different when your girl is around? Plus, with
the fact of the stolen bag, things get a little bit mroe
complicated. He aso lost his dad's watch... that must have been rough.

<P>So he lost all this stuff, and I didn't lose anything at all. This
creates a little discrepancy between our states of mind. I have no
reason not to be happy .He, especially in these days, has to force
himself to be happy. Until he gets out of the anger phase of wanting
to know where his stuff is, what the bastard that sotle it is doing
with it, ad how he looks like, and if he's young or old or expierned
or not.

<P>But tomorrow is sunday, and we have to go back to Jerusalem, and on
Monday Corinna has to work. Maybe things will change, I don't
know. Maybe I should tell him. Maybe it woudlnt help.
