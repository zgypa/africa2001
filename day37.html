      Wake up at around 11, and I wrote some diary. Brooke showd up at
      12 but I was not ready yet, so I told him to go. I finished
      doing my things, thenI came out and tried to change some money
      at the hotel bar. At first they seemed interested in giving me a
      8.2birr/$,but then it turned out they didn't ahve enough birr
      for $20, so I just changed my Ksh, which were not enough to
      catch the bus. Iwas therefore thinking of changing money at the
      bank on monday, and then leaving on tuesday. I had lunch with
      brooke and some dude from the hotel at the restaurant behind the
      bar I went to last night with Anthony and brooke.  There we ate
      the traditial kitfu with the traditional yiest bread. Of course
      I paid for their meal. They were not thanking me for the meal so
      I told brooke that you are supposed to say thank you or show
      some appreciation if somebody buys you something, and he told me
      that in Ethipia for foood there is no problem. You don't thank
      for food. I thought it was kind of strange. he also started
      talking about some coffee ceremony... I might have to check it
      out.
    </P>
    <P>
      After lunch I was ready to change some money, so we tried to see
      if there was something on the street. But then we got apporached
      by some dodgey bloke, big and threatning looking. I recon he was
      trying to make some money off a bribe, in case he caught
      somebody exchanging money illegally on the street. So I got
      scared and didn't change anything.

      By this time, we ran into Sami, who was now walking. He walked
      with us to the hotel bar, where we all had a soda, then we
      talked a little at the table, he wrote something in the
      sketchbook, and then the money exchanging came up again.  It was
      true that if I were to wait for the banks, I was going to have
      to wait another 2 days. So i told Brooke that if we wanted to
      exchange money on the street, he could. That I was happy with a
      8.2/$ rate, and that he could then keep the difference. But he
      had to do it for me. I gave him $20, then he was off, and
      Anthony and Sami stayed with me. After a long time, he came back
      with another dude, who said was going to change, but only in
      front of me, because he did not trust Brooke. When I heard this
      I was very scared. Ithought this was a setup again. Butinstead
      it was OK. I got a 8.3 rate and gave the extra .1/$ to Brooke,
      as promised, as he started begging for more money. First he
      asked for money. Then I said that I gave him 150Ksh the night
      before, so he could use that money, if he hadn't spent it
      yet. He said he spent it already, so I told him that that was
      his problem. He shouldn't have. So he decided to ask for the
      .1birr/$ that he at first was ready to be polite and refuse. I
      laughed and gave it to him.
    </P>
    <P>
      They were all off, and I went to my room to rest. i started reading the Asimov 
      book, "I, Robot" upto about 6pm, then I went to the bus station and they gave 
      me a ticket for the next day for 38 birr upto Dila. On my way back I ran into 
      Brooke, who was sitting atthe Tourist Hotel. I stopped in, and he told me that 
      he had ran into these Italian friends, that worked here, he forgto to tell me 
      about. And asked me if I wanted to be taken to them. I sayed "sure" and we got 
      picked up by a car with "EC" stickers on the door. And that's how I met Rudi 
      and Gert.
    </P>
    <P>
      LVIA is the association they work for here. They get 2 year contracts, do 
      proposals, and then get money for these projects. They get paid about 1.3milion 
      Lira per month and are now overloaded with work. They work with water, 
      drillling for wells, they arebullding a kindergarden, and other stuff. They are 
      nice people, and have hired a team of locals to help them.
    </P>
    <P>
      I was even more lucky to find out that tonight was party night: an engineer was 
      going to leave, so they were throghing a party for him. Dinner was prepared, 
      two [capre], one prepared according to muslim religion, the other according to 
      the crhistian one. The two religions were a little separated , but just for 
      making things easier, not to segregate.
    </P>
    <P>
      Here in Ethiopia there are many, many diffrent cultures, so it seems that 
      people are used to living with each other and accepting the different 
      religions. The dinner was OK, and didn't last too long. Then there were the 
      tear-ripping ("strappalacrime"),as Gert defined them, talks of everyone. These 
      are just thank you speeches or little ceremony speeches that they hold for the 
      special occasions. And Geert had to hold hte speech too, as he is the 
      coordinator. He says that he hates these speeched, that he hates publich 
      speaking, and that he thinks they are all useless. But he held one, and he says 
      "Impara l'arte e mettila da parte". In my opinion his speech was very canned, 
      but he knows it, and says it is useless to try to make some speech where one 
      could try to teach something in such a sad moment: people are moved then and 
      there, but then the next day they are the same. I respect his point of view.
    </P>
    <P>
      So he told me these things while going to his house to pick up the grappa. His 
      house is very nice, with a real toilet seat, that he bought himslef and 
      isntalled. He also has a solar panel in his house, with a truck 12V battery, 
      and a "Helios Technoloy HT8 charge controller" unit. He says he can go 
      literally the whole night with lights on. He has plenty of power. After a 
      little smoke, we went back to the LVIA offices to the party. I had to remind 
      Gert about the grappa, since he was forgetting about it already.
    </P>
    <P>
      When we got back there, people were dancing and going wild. The engineer was 
      dancing too, in his 60's, and doing very well. He is still a very strong man. 
      Everyone got smashed. After more and more dancing, we decided to go to a bar, 
      for a few minutes, since power was going to go out (Oh, yeah, I haven't told 
      you yet? Here there is power about 12 hours /day, fom noon, until midnight. 
      Then no more power. So all music and bars close.).
    </P>
    <P>
      The place we went to was a little room, with a bar, and some stools with more 
      small tables. Te room was probably 7-8meters long and had huge blasting 
      speakers. The temperature in there was really high. We had a beer, and I was 
      glad when the power went out, so we could all go outside. And so we walked back 
      to Gert and Rudi's place, and had some more Rum there. Of course they have 
      light because of the solar panels, so showing it and turning it on is a must. 
      Considering that one of these solar panels are about $500, they are totally 
      unthinkable for locals.
    </P>
    <P>
      I tried to explain about T-Wave alternans to a local technician that works in a 
      store, but that did not go well at all. He was way too drunk. I must say I 
      definetely succeeded more explaining gravity and force to the boys on the boat 
      to Dar, and the next day talking about physics with a bartender and person in Arusha.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then everyone left. I was left with the italians who I chatted with for a 
      little while longer, then Gert walked me back to the hotel, but nobody would 
      open (it was 2:30am). Se we came back, he put me to sleep in this small room of 
      his outside, next to the high class latrine, and I tried to wake up at 4:10am 
      to go see if I could get into my hotel to get stuff, so I could leve with the 
      6am but (they wanted me to be at the bus stop at 5am), but also at that time, I 
      could not get in. This time I walked down the Moyale back street alone. It was 
      really shady. Not as shady as it was walking down the main street with Gert. On 
      the main street there is always somebody. Maybe a military guy that could annoy 
      you with questions. When we ran into one, Gert promptly flashed the light on 
      our faces, and told them we were from LVIA, and the guy didn't bother annoying 
      us further.
    </P>
    <P>
      I now have to wait another day and see if I can talk the bus guys into letting 
      me not pay for another fair again. It was definetely worth it, though. Great 
      party, great people and great experince. The best I had had in a long time.
