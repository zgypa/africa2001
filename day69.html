    <h1>Day 69 - Shahandi, Ethiopia</h1>
    <h2>Wednesday August 1<sup>st</sup>, 2001</h2>

    <P>Bus to Metema was a trip. Incredible. It was pretty bad and the
    road got muddy and the bus kept on getting stuck. And the driver
    kept on holding tight on the steering wheel when we was getting
    pulled out of holes, so we eventually ran into some serious
    steering problems. We ended up having to bend the steering rod
    back by lifting the bus on jacks, then putting rocks under the
    bend of the rod, then dropping the weight of the bus onto it. And
    I was looking, and of course I don't understand a word of what
    they say, so I just looked, and for once I was able to understand
    what the hell they were doing, and said to myself: "Hmmm, yeah,
    this time it actually makes sense. Yeah, that's a pretty good
    idea." And in fact it worked pretty well. But then this truck, a
    caterpillar, was toeing us out of a very steep hole, and by the
    time we were out of the whole, the right front hub was
    perpendicular to the street, while the left one was parallel to
    it. We got saved by this army truck a russian 6wheeler which gave
    most of us a ride to the next town. That was an amazing
    trip. Finally on a kick-ass truck. This thing was really great, it
    could fly on any road, with 6 wheel drive and extra compressors
    for tires, so to have un-flattable tires. Great for driving
    through open fires. Sounds like fun. Mengistab a soldier I met on
    the truck promised to take me to Metema tomorrow. We do have an
    exhaust manifold problem, nonetheless.</p>
