    <P>
      Indeed we did leave tat 6am, but not Africa time, rather real time. It hwppned. 
      aAnd off we went. this was the hardest day of all, the reason being that I was 
      till on top with the freight and the mass of people, and the road was not 
      Tamak, or rahter it was a dirt road. That's when my cold got worse. Westopped 
      about 4 times to change tires, it was always the rear right side that had 
      problems. amd they way they were doing things, I m suprised we only sopped 4 
      times. First it was the outside tire, then tie inside then the inside tire was 
      put outside, and the outisde, inside. Then the outside tire again. Every stop 
      was from 30-90 minutes. depneding on how many times they had to put hte tire 
      back on to fibure out they had to take it off again.
    </P>
    <P>
      The ride wa spectacular, though. Being in the truck, and being the truck so 
      crowded, I could not see much, bue whe I was, I liked it a lot. Also, we picked 
      up somemilitary/seurityguards, with guns which were very alert. What Mike was 
      saying was kind of bullshit: He was saying that there are no cnvoys annd that 
      there is no problem up there. But instad there is: I have seen convoys of 3-4 
      trucks, and averytime we stopped because of a puncture, other people would stop 
      there too, to fix up what they had to fix up, so they didn't have to stop inan 
      area alone. Talking to the military guys, they told me that myabe like 3% of 
      the trips get mugged. Andti usually happens when it rains, tht the truck get 
      stuck in the mud that the people come. out of bushes, and just tsteal valuables 
      from passangers, becaseu they don't knw how to drive a truck according to the 
      lmiltary guy) I have a hard tie believgin this, becuase there are mitsubishi 
      trucks (most of them are the same model, I think somebody gave them these tuck 
      somehow, but I don't know the exact strory) and these truck are really easy to 
      drive: they have 5 gears only and the only thig they have different from cars, 
      si the brakes.
    </P>
    <P>
      At any rate, also locals hopped on the truck for a brief stretch, and these 
      ladies were dressed sort of like Masai, but I don't think they were Msai. I 
      think they were from a different trie.. They were wearing basically nothing, 
      but a blanket, sor to like themasai blanket I got. an they looked really old, 
      but ina weird way: They had deep and many wrinkles, but the skin was not 
      looking too old.. The wrinkles were limited to were they had wrinkles. It 
      seemed like they didn't get too many extra wrinkles. It was just that the ones 
      that they hd got bigger and deeper. I wonder what theyr age was. But these 
      ladies were able to climbon top of the truck and were travelling on top with 
      the cargo no problem.

      After plety stops, we finally arrrived in Marsabit, a 277km drive which took us 
      about 12 hours.
    </P>
    <P>
      The senary, the deserts, and the skies weremarveloous though. At some point, 
      some guy suggested tath we would have slept there that night(bedause of the 
      frequent tire prolems) and I was very excited by the idea. But on the other 
      side, I was thinking that I was a little scared and that it might have bee 
      safer to sleep on the truck, rather then pitching my tent. But all this did not 
      happen.
    </P>
    <P>
      Instead we arrived inMarsabit, and I stayed at this lodge, in the same room 
      withthe driver. The people at the lodge were very nice and gave me some 
      medicine for the nasal congestion I was having. Also the driver said that I 
      could stay and sit inside the cabin the xt day, instead of having to stay 
      withte cargo. The night went quite well, the driver didnt' realy snore at all.
