    <h1>Day 65 - Addis Ababa, Ethiopia</h1>
    <h2>Saturday July 28<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

    <P> Wake @ 11:30 by Dan, but I did not want to wake up. He had a
    little to smoke and then was out for errands. I slept until
    4:30.</p>

    <P>Got lucky @ Baro Hotel with Internet: dicked around a little ,
    then connection finally worked. Got charged 10BE for 45mins
    0.22BE/min. During this time I transfered the logbook of Gigi to
    brillig.org, but was not able to finish transferring my guestbook,
    nor was I able to do the final test of it. It'll have to wait
    until Khartoum.</p>

    <P>Went to look for some place to eat. Internet was on list but
    didn't happen. Ate at the third floor of the cluster of high class
    bars/restaurants just on the road that conncts piazza to
    churchill. Met Florian there, but didn't eat with him. Our place
    up there (top floor the bar restaurant that is double, next to the
    stairs) was not great. They had better hamburgers at the Nazret
    Pension, to tell you the truth.</p>

    <P>It was then time to pack. But before that, Dan wanted to go see
    the view from the water container of the Wutma, the container that
    is placed at a height so to get pressure out of it. He went up
    there, then foud a way to sit on it, so I climbed too and we had a
    little smoke as he panned around with his Canon "Elura 2 MC" to
    get a full view of the city, Addis Ababa. Was pretty neat. Then we
    saw the sunset. Aftually the sunset was the origianl reason of why
    he first went there in the first place.
