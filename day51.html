   Day 51 - Lalibela, Ethiopia
  </H1>
  <H2>
   Saturday July 14<SUP>th</SUP>, 2001
  </H2>
  <P>
   Waking up in a bed with 4 hours of semi sleep with Dani next to me
   at 3:45am and hopping on the bus that would finally take us to
   Weldiya. The bus trip was only like 3 hours long. In the bus the
   military guy/soldier that told me he had malaria yesterday, came
   back and sat in his seat, the one next to me. Yes I was hoping he
   would sit somewhere else like he did yesterday. Instead he sat next
   to me just by the window and kept on spitting and spitting. It was
   obviously still dark outside, and I was able to somehow sleep
   resting my head on my arms which in turn were resting on the back
   of the seat in front of me.  The position was extremely
   uncomfortable, but not worse than the day before. The whole day
   before. The only differece: it was dark.</p>
  <P>
   We got to Woldyia at around 7-7:30am, and some guy told us we had
   to go to another bus station. That is, we could not just wait for
   the bus there where we got dropped off. So we started to walk with
   this guy, and walk and the walk was kind of funny in a way, since
   we really didn't aunderstand what he was saying or doing or why he
   was yelling at busses, or what. But as Dan was saying, "The word
   has been uttered". We obviously had said <i>Lalibela</i> so they
   knew we were trying to go to Lalibela. Eventually, Dan, for some
   reason , which to me seemed funny, since I started to giggle,
   started to run. I didn't know the reason, but I had the impression
   that he was running for the wrong reason. But it was good that he
   was doing it. I mean, we were not late or anything, but sometimes
   you just never know.</p>
  <P>
   The other bus station really existed, and the Lalibela bus was
   really there. It cost us 25 birr to get on the bus, and the guy
   that showed us the way, well, actually Dan thought it was a good
   idea to give him some small amount of money, like 1 birr, for the
   courtesy. After all, he had initially started to carry Dan's
   luggage down the street. But the guy seemed to be offended when Dan
   offered the money. So Dan thought that maybe he didn't want the
   money. Well it turned out that, that yes, he was offended, but he
   was rather playing offended because he wanted more. He had being
   carrying the luggage (and was acting out how he was carrying the
   luggage) and therefore wanted at least 5 birr (another guy, the bus
   guy, translated for him). So I gave him a 2 birr, partially because
   I thought we should give him some money for the service he provided
   us with, and partly because he also put our luggage up on the roof
   of the bus. Eventaully Dan gave him another birr. </p>
  <P>
   Sometimes I wonder if I should keep my mouth shut, since maybe he
   was trying to bargain a better price for the tip down, but I don't
   think so. There is no lower bargaining than that I think. I think a
   2-3birr each was the fair amount. But 1 birr was not enough. Dan
   correctly pointed out, though, that no matter how much you give
   these guys, they will always complain: and he took as an example
   the whore, whome he paid in USD, and she still was complaining as
   she walked out the door although he gave her twice of what he
   should have... But you have to realize how stressful it is to have
   to deal with these situations all the time, when you never know if
   you are giving the right amount, an onest amount, or if they are
   simply fucking with you.</p>
  <P>
   Since the bus wasn't going to leave for a good 5 hourse, we ended
   up going on a search for some breakfast. And sure enough we found
   something at our second attempt. So we had bread and scrambled
   eggs, which they seem to be able to do farily well here. And at
   that place, we started talking with some locals.  Or rather, Dan
   started more with that. So we talked to this kid, who was following
   us, and whom we gave some of our breakfast as he was attempting to
   fix a watch, which was obviously dead and could have only been
   fixed with delicate hands of a delicate person with small tools in
   a lab. The boy was trying with his bare hands... I would have hated
   to have to tell him about the faith of his watch. Luckily I didn't
   have to. He soon figured it out by himself.</p>
  <P>
   By now we had figured out that the bus, which we just bought
   tickets for, was going to leave only at 10am or shortly therefater,
   since that was when the bus from Addis, a different one, would
   arrive. And they would make it fill up. This meant we had about 3
   more hours to kill. And we pretty much spent them at that bar talking
   to the locals some of them being still in school, like 9th grade,
   some of them bieng 23 and runners.</p>
  <P>
   It was time to board the bus, and we did, and we sat on our seats,
   which were apparently a good choice this time. Since we came early,
   we picked the first bench of the bus, just behind the driver. The
   second best seats, as the ones next to the driver were already
   taken. As it turned out, these seats were a very bad choice as they
   were slightly tilted downward, and the padding was shot giving us
   very fast squared butts.</p>

  <P>
   According to Dan's guide, the ride was supposed to be 4-6 hours,
   depending on the quality of the vehicle, but also the guide was
   wrong. We left at about 10:30 and arrived around 7pm, which makes
   the ride about 9 hours. All bus rides seem to be 9 hours. This one
   was supposed to be 120km, which, in 9 hours, averages down to about
   a little more than 15km/h. Not bad, ha? Well, the reason for this
   was that the engine was shot, probably didn't have any comrepssion
   anymore, and the streets were very steep.</p>

  <P>
   But the scenery was spectacular, and the bus would stop in little
   places, on the highlands, it would drop off more and more people,
   making the ride a little more confortable and cozy. The Highlands
   where we had lunch were marvelous. There is a lot of highland. Very
   fast and very pretty. Then we descended down again, and the view
   was just spectaccuarr. Too bad we were not with our own
   vehicle. That would have been great.</p>

  <P>
   We finally arrived in Lalibela. The luggage was a little
   wet. Dan's pack suffered a little more tha mine, since he didn't
   have the waterproof rain cover on it. It was interesting to see how
   he was annoyed by it, but then not too much since it wasn't a
   surprise. He gets annoyed, but then he realizes that this is the
   price he has to pay for travelling, so he calms back down
   again.</p>

  <P>
   A local guide took us to some hotel, which only had one bed left,
   and then he took us to another shit hole, which is where we are
   staying now. For 20birr both of us. Price is low, but place is
   horrible. We had the guide take us to eat to a restaurant, were we
   eventually ran into thses brits we had met in Addis, at Dan's
   hotel. And there there was a great deal of people, including an
   Italian from Genvoa Pegli, who is a school teacher and teaches or
   rather comes to Addis every year at the school for the maturitá
   examination. Carlo Molina. But then he told me of his knee, and how
   he fell into a pit in Gondar... and how he met Guido, a vet, with a
   motorcycle who got stuck and was waiting for spare
   parts. Apparently he is staying at the circle hotel in Gondar.</p>

  <P>
   And then I ate, and then I met this funy little couple, she was
   from Japan, and he, we don't really know, but they came from the
   north, doing the same trip that Mike did, which is my trip, but
   backwards. They told me about Sudan. I got scared, but I shouldn't
   be scared. The scary part is the weather (extremeley hot, like 40),
   the streets, muddy, caused by the rains, and the transportation
   (having to find a ride fromo Gedaref to Metema, or rather from
   Metema do Gedaref. Also scary is the paper work I must do as a
   traveller, where I declare all my movements. They say I have 3 days
   to get to Khartoum where I can do the burocracy for free at the
   tourist office. But I think I will just pay the $17 in Metema and
   get it done there. The reson being that it took them 2 days to do
   Gedaref Metema, and the rain season had just started. Now that we
   are in full rain season, it might take just 3 days to get to
   Gedaref, which might be a problem. At any rate, I am getting
   inspired by Dan. So I am not too worried. Tomorrow we will go to
   the tourist office here and buy tickets for the churches of
   Lalibela. I am pretty excited.</p>
  <P>
   The sleep in the cheap'o Kademnt Hotel was pretty cheap'o. Dan was
   about to take a shit.  Then, as he saw the shithole, he decided not
   to. He didn't feel like it anymore, let's just keep it to that. He
   slept with a mosquito net, full size, I slept with the head
   net.</p>
