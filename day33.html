      Day 33 - Nairobi, Kenya

    <P>
      I am coming to the conclusion that the people here are used to working their 
      asses off. They could come to america and work 3 jobs easy. And they are used 
      to doing it for their whole lives, then reaching age of retirement without a 
      penny, or actualy with some money, but nothing close to western money. Some 
      people work all the time, and still after 30-40 years of working they canot 
      even afford 100USD.
    </P>
    <P>
      I picked up my passport VISA and went to see if I could get a VISA for Sudan. I 
      talked to Mike, and he told me that he came through sudan no problem. . He is 
      iactually from Romania, and has spent the last 4 years on the road, 2 years in 
      Egyptsome month inTurkey, and now a few month in Nairobi. He ususes the internt 
      to travel: he designs webpages, and since now there is internet everywhere, 
      when he runs out of money, hemakes sure he ends up in a big city, then goes to 
      see if there is somebody who wants a webpage, by showingthem the pages he has 
      done so far. And since he is pretty good, he alwways gets a job. Then, he 
      leaves again . But now he has to go back home for Christmas. And then he will 
      go again, travel.
    </P>
    <P>
      At any rate, he told me to go trhough Sudan, that there is no problem. The only 
      plroblem is the VISA. It takes at least 3 days and 4 phoatos, with letter of 
      reccomdationf from your own embassy. I tried to get it in Nairobi, but they 
      told me that they onlyissue business VISAs. Then, as I was walking down the 
      stairs o leave, I rememberd never to assume anything, so I went back upstairs 
      to bthe Sudan embassy lady, andasked her if it was possible a all to get a 
      tourist visa, and she told me to try in Addis Ababa, as they might issue them there.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then, when I came home that night, I talked to Mike about it, and we was very 
      surprised: He said that that was very funny since they issued a VISA to a guy 
      from Holland about a few weeks ago. Then I told Mike that hte lady at the 
      embassy also told me that they had not been issueing tourrist visas since 
      january first and that I had not told her my nationality until after she told 
      me that they don't issue VISAs for tourism. Maybe she recognized my acent 
      asbing from America?
    </P>
    <P>
      The evening was a lazy one. After a chicken dinner at the hostel, and after 
      playing around with Mike to try to get the scanner to work, I went to bed , 
      already thinking to leave the next morning.
