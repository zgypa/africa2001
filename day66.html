    <h1>Day 66 - F'nota Salam, Ethiopia</h1>
    <h2>Sunday July 29<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

    <P>"Dan yelles to bus driver to get money back, so he could get on
    the next bus, which appeared to be leaving earlier."</p>

    <P>He made the assumption, and thus a mistake, that the long
    distance buses leave like the minibusses in town. Or rather, he
    didn't really make a mistake, because that is kind of how they
    work. But his mistake was actually trying to get on the earlier
    bus once we had the tickets for the later bus already. Of course
    the bus driver didn't want to give money back for a sold ticket,
    so Dan had to yell at him. Until he finally did. But Dan was
    yelling. And I saw it coming. I don't know why, but I did. Of
    course, once he went to buy the tickets for the other bus, the bus
    driver told him it was full. So he had to go back and buy the
    ticket back from the first guy... Let me tell you, it was
    something. But he managed...</p>

    <P>Then the Government ordered the whole bus station drivers to
    transfer all their passengers to the new arrived buses. It would
    then hire all the bus station buses for some weird purpose. So we
    didn't end up having to be 2 days with people whom he had just
    yelled at. But in the meanwhile, Dan was already thinking of not
    leaving today at all. Of just going back home, to the Wutma, and
    maybe flying. Good thing he didn't follow through with this
    one. In fact, he was thinking of how he shouldn't have interrupted
    his Omo trip (he wasted much time this way). He laughed when I
    said: "OK, it could have been perfect, now instead it's just
    great." but the rest of the time he was going in some pretty
    serious phases of self meditation there. All and all I found this
    behavior to be kinda childish, but I don't know Dan that well to
    be able to make such a judgement. There could be some different
    element in the personality that I am not aware of...</p>

    <P>Then we stop for lunch at this place in Bahar Dar and order
    the food and the lady wants the money immediately. Dan tells her
    that that is not how it's usually done, and she leaves. This is
    enough for a person to be defined as a "cunt" by Dan, which
    litterally cracks me up.<br> I just love it when he says it.</p>

    <P>All answers I get don't really mean much: "I just do it becauSe
    we always have done it like this".</p>

    <P>soil in south: rain forest like. in north there is a lot more
    soil.</p>
