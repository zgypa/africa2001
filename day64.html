    <h1>Day 64 - Addis Ababa, Ethiopia</h1>
    <h2>Friday July 27<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

    <P>A pretty straight forward day. Me and Dan. We go to the Sudan
    Embassy drop off passport. And then to the Memo Night Club to pick
    up forgotten knife.</p>

    <P>Normal looking teens that were inviting me to do something. The
    action of the hands indicated carrying something, bus since I was
    carrying nothing, I excluded the possibility of them offering to
    carry something for me.</p>

    <P>Then I took the wrong minibus in bus-mode, so got off and
    started asking for the minibus that headed towards Piazza. The
    directions I was getting were very misleading,and out of the 3
    people interrogated, I couldn't get anything useful: they all
    indicated a different direcction. Only then I realized that I
    actually knew exactly where we were, sice I got off as soon as I
    relized that the minibus was going the wrong way. And I simply
    headed back, to were the minibusses to Piazza do drive to pick one
    up.</p>
 
    <P>On the way there is when I happened to hit the Eyo-Ta
    Supermarket, located behind the Stadium, which happened to
    coincidentally be the plae where I realized we were going the
    wrong way, just before I got off that minibus. The girls in there
    (the storekeepers and helpers and family) are crazy, but crazy in
    a good way. They like to play a lot. Like this girl was insisting
    to marry me, and was offering me a ring, which coincidentally was
    on her left ringfinger, but was supposed to have no marrital
    meaning whatsoever.</p>

    <P>Dan to a beggar: "I appreciate all you have done for me, but I
    still wont give you anything",obviously referring to one of the
    just coined beggee rules: "I only give money to people who tender
    a service, seniors and cripples. 'Cuz what else are they gonna
    do?"</p>

    <P>15:37 "Christ in a bag" (danglass66)</p>

    <P>"Fruit House" by Giorgis Sq. is supposeed to have the best
    juices in town.</p>

    <P>Spend 45 minutes in an italian bookstore called "Libreria
    Italiana" looking for sometihng affordable to buy. Luciano
    DeCrescenzo was between 120-130EB. Eventually I decided on Italo
    Calivino, Il barone rampante which was only 28EB. These were the
    only people I met that could speak italian (apart from the
    Italians I met). And they just learned it from other Ialians, or
    in the Italian school that is there.</p>

    <P>Head back to Wutma and meet Dan, and we have lunch there
    (lasagna, cold but good). Then we hung the map of ethiopia on the
    wall in his room, and he started to plan his trip. This planning, I
    would say, took a good 1.5h, thats 90 minutes of staring at a wall
    with a map on it. One thing I can say about him: he is definetely
    very thorough when making decisions.</p>

    <P>So I took off in the searh of some recording unit similar to
    his. I thought it would in fact be good idea to record some
    noises. I picked up Shereef, and he took me to Merkato. There I
    kinda lost hope for it, since the only stores that had portable
    recorders, these were shitty, and din't have a MIC IN jack. But I
    got to see the Merkato, the famous Merkato, which is supposed to
    be the largest in Africa. Walking down these alleys I realized what
    would be the most touristy, or rather, authentic tourist/souvenir
    shirt: TITANIC. But instead I bought a FILA rain jacket, no hood,
    double-face, grey and blue for 140EB.</p>

    <P>Eventually we got to this Supermaket, apparently the biggest
    in Addis, but I 'm not sure, were I find a big fat nothing at
    first. Not even the AUTAN bug repellant (which I had seen in
    another supermeket weeks ago, but was too expensive) was an item
    they could provide me with and still gain a lot of pleaseure from
    opening and closing doors.</p>

    <P>Gideon dictates Guy's and Tony's respect theory... with gory
    deatails at the Nazaret Pension.</p>

    <P>"Maybe you [the west] are not civilized" (Gideon). Maybe the
    Ethiopian culture is the way to go.</p>

    <P>"You are having a good time, I know, but I believe you don't
    know how to have a good time.... Maybe it's good not to know about
    how to have a good time. " (Gideon)</p>

    <P>Be'tae'am=(Be: in; tae'am flavour. Used inn conjunction with
    Amesegenalllo and means "Thank you very much".</p>

    <P>Laetam Berhanu (world light, a light for the world) and it was
    the name of some guy.
