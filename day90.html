    <h1>Day 90 - Jerusalem, Israel</h1>
<h2>Wednesday August 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2001</h2>

<P>• Today Guy took me to see Yavd Vashem, this museum built on
Mt. Herzl (Theodor Herzl was the one who wrote "Der Judenstaat") in
memory of the Holocoaust. It's a big campus with mnuments and
expositions all over, including a childrens memorial, a room full of
candles, or so it looks like. There are mirrors, and aas you enter all
you see are small candlelights all over, and you hear a voice reading
out the name and the age of the children that perished in the
holocaust. Then there is a sort of sinagogue, which is used for
ceremonies, with a sort of fireplace in the middle, and an art museum,
with artwork that was taken away by the Nazis. Also a children's musem
with all children's article and memories and videos with stories. Then
there is a train cart, a german train fart on a bridge which is only
half buillt, to symbolize the deportation. It probably is an origianl
cart, knowing how the Israeli's don't fuck around.. At the end they
built a sort of labyrinth, more or less in the shape of Europe. It's
more like many rooms with no roof, than a labyrynth, and in every room
on the wall there are names of towns and cities which had Jewish
comunities. Definetely a job well done. Lots of money put into it, but
it was nothing new for me. Definetely not as interesting as the old
city tour, but pretty impressive.

<P>• The same nite we went to Tel Aviv, where I met Smira, Guy's mum,
she gave me an Esprit t-shirt and told me she was going to go to study
English, and the next tie I would come she would speak fluent
English. Guy said "roouuaa--t". They showed me Guy's dad pictures,
some of them at least, they showed me Guy's sister's bedroom, and
memories. Smira is very nice and fun and good looking. She seems to
like me too.  And me? I like her, sure. There a little of comunicaiton
barrier, but she seems happy and cool and fun.

<P>• guy's house, where he grew up is pretty small. Reminds me of
Mauro's house, I don't know why, although it's alot smaller than his
old house.

<P>• W@e then went to pick up the immobilizer and the alarm remote
from Amir's (Guy's siter boyfriend) house. And we headed to meet Gal
and Tomer and Yossi. We ate in this expensive place, and Gal was
telling me how they might not let me in, because of my clothes. I
hadn't even shaved and had dirty pants, and a shitty t-shirt...  Tomer
plays percussion and told us about this Terry Bozio video he saw and
how he is totally sweet and gay during the interview, but then when he
plays he undergoes this metamorphoses. With Yossi I had little to do,
and didn't talk much.

<P>• The Gay club was basically a club scene: Gal gave me one of his
black shirts (btw, I've gotta buy one of those) and we went in, and he
bought me a malibu-orange, and got himself a beer. Loud 80's music (it
seems very popular in Israel here now). Then we went out to meet Guy,
and I decided to go home with guy and corinna (she had to leave by
1am, since she ahd to work the next day so I was kind of making plans
to come back to Tel Aviv on my own with a bus or with Tomer, who is
recording in Jersualem, and was going to do the trip in the morning)
to go home with them then. We said by to Gal, I might meet him in
Italy, when he comes. I hope so, he is a nice guy. And fun. Everytime
i hang out with him I have this wierd feeling of comfortableness...

<P>• When we came home, Corinna gave me a nite lamp and told me to use
that one because the big one would bother her. That was good. I had
lready sensed that though. The tow nites before I was up and could
here noisesof annoyance from the bed until I would turn the light off,
and do my things in the dark, then peace would reign. All good.
