    <h1>Day 74 - Khartoum, Sudan</h1>
<h2>Monday August 6<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

<P>• Registration @ Aliens Registration office. 700 SD

<P>• Meet Germans by their Embassy

<P>• Go to bank with them. Can they get money transferred from
Germany? Bank of Abu Dhabi says "yes".

<P>• Walk to travel agency. There I met a guy who worked in this
store, the store the man took e yesterday to show me were I could
change money. Apparently he is from Toledo.

<P>• Lost German friends who were in a hurry to call their mum to wire
the money. Headed back towards their hotel, so I could go my self to
the US embassy (just behind their hotel).

<P>• Find them lounging there. Uli said we were going to meet Kelly at
3pm to go to Museum. In the meanwhile we go ru some errands. Look for
microphone

<P>• In the search werun into this office building, a lot like a
european one, were you can ret a studio for 50,000-100,000SD per
month. Met The lawyer there, who would not stop talking.

<P>• Got to Htoel to meeet Kelly late, at about 3.10pm, she decided
not to come to Museum. stead she gavfe3 me her passport to get the
Meroe permit also for her.

<P>• Me and Uli take off, get to the Museum, only to find out that it
is closed on Mondays. Also dhte Dept. of Antiquities is closed on
Mondays.

<P>• I tell him that he should do what he wants to do in terms of
leavnig for Greece. He thinks about it and seems to want to go to
Egypt with me instead. Tomorrow he will make he final decision.

<P>• So we go to the Family Park, were there is a zoo, and we are able
not to pay for the zoo, by telling the guy we have no money. That was
good, cuz it was really horrible to see a zoo here in africa.

<P>• Then we strolled around the park and talked about Linux. We
finally headed towards the bridge to see the sun set over the nile,
the blue and the white nile.

<P>• The bridege was very nice. I mean it was OK. Pretty long, and
lots of water becasue of the season.

<P>• We then stopped nad chatted with soldiers on the other side of
the bridge, who said they hated John G. or whatever his name is, the
founder of the SPLM and SPLA.

<P>• The susnet was Nice, it was looking klike a whol in the
jhemisphere of the sky, as Uli descibed it.But nothing really specail
becaseu there were no clouds at all.

<P>• Then we headed back looking for some place to eat. It was once we
got to his hotel that we found out that the boys, the other germands,
actually were not there, so we hung out with Kelly for a while then
shooted out again to searhc for more places to eat.

<P>• this search was not easy, becuase it had to be a place were they
serverd no food. So we walked for a while and people took us all over
the place. We finally ended up in UN square, in a burger place, where
Uli had a burger with 2 eggs, instead of the meat.

<P>• We then parted and set up to meet tomorrow. at the hotel aroud
noon.

<P>• Khartoum is a strange city: during the day it is crazy, crouded
like Napels, you can't even ride a bike. Then at nite, it's totally
dead, no restaruants, no night clubs, , no people on the streets, no
cars, no traffic, nothing. A dead city. A city with lights every nnow
and then, but... just very weird.
