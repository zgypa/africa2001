	Day 49 - Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
      </H1>
      <H2>
	Thursday July 12<SUP>th</SUP>, 2001
      </H2>
      <P>
	Today is the day I have to make a decision about going to
	visit north Ethiopia with Dan. And I decide to do it. What
	reason to stay in Addis and wait for a VISA that might take
	weeks to be ready? In fact, I still didn't get a
	confirmation. I called and checked today as well.
	Plus Dan feels uncomfortable: he feels like he is wasting too
	much time, and wants to leave very soon for the trip.
      </p>
      <p>
	As I still don't feel well, I decide to stay home. Dan meets
	up with his friends (still haven't quite figured out how he
	met them) and they go to the Merkato. So I take advantage of
	the situation and ask him to pick up a brush for my jungle
	boots. And indeed he does. He picks up this brush for 1 birr
	(!!) which is all handmade with natural hair, probably from a
	donkey. Pretty cool brush, and pretty cheap, too! It was a
	gift from him to me.</p>
