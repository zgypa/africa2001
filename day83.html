    <h1>Day 83 - Cairo, Egypt</h1>
<h2>Wednesday August 15, 2001</h2>


<P>• $1=4.51E£

<P>• Sudan Embassy to change dinar. Indicated me the Abu Sinbl Hotel
in Attaba square. Hard to find. Changed 8750SD for 100E£ losing
ca.$10. Better than nothing.

<P>• Khan Khali market to buy shisha. Hard: 132E£ for:
<UL>
<LI>2 good pipes
<LI>1 green glass
<LI>1 heavy duty tube
<LI>1 ebony mouth piece
<LI>3 burners
<LI>1 brass tweezers
<LI>2 heavy duty chromed dishes
</UL>

• 5E£ for 250g tobacco pouches.

<P>• Trasformi l'idea di avare un figlio in una prigione. Bel pensioro
e modo di esprimiere quelli che, come cinzia, a volte, si taglia le
gambe quando ha un figlio, perche' fare cose con lui/lei sarebbe un
problema inveced id affrontare le difficolta' e continuare a fare
tutto cio' che si faceva prima entro limiti) anche con il fitlio (un
po' alla Arianna).

<P>• Here at the Sun hotel one can here Cairo. As i said , it's a very
big city, and honking is a very big activity. From this crossing, one
of the most important ones in the city, Tahrir square, one can hear as
every single driver that passes by drops it's share of acoustic
pollution by honking at least for millisecond: Bp! while others just
drive around, and you (engineer) ask yourself if they actually wired
the honk switch closed. I have also seen a bicycle with a bell
connected to the front wheel, and everytime the bicycle is moving
brrrrrrRRRRRRrrrrrrrrRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrrRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrRRRRRR
and the "ing" never comes. It's just crazy.

<P>• I keep spitting white flem, this is getting boring. I wish I
could produce some energy from i, burn it or donate it. I feel like I
want it to be useful, if it has to continue for a longer period of
time.
