    <h1>Day 80 - Khartoum, Sudan</h1>
<h2>Sunday August 12<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

<P>I decided to fly to Cairo. I will check for the flight prices, but
I don't think they will be more than 250USD. And if they are I will
try to go to the airport and see if I can standby.

<P>Travelling by public transport is definetely not the way to travel
through Africa, as you cannot get the best out of it. It is a good
idea to see what it's like. And it's good to do if you work here, and
have to just move from one city to the other. But havvig to cvarry
your whole house with you makes it harder. You also don't get a good
chance at seeing things,as sometimes you don't get window seats, or
you are in the back of a truck, and cvan't see outside. You cannot
stop and look at sceneries when you want. You can't buy all the
souvenirs you want, because you know you can't carry them. The bottom
line is that it's very difficult.

<P>The trip from here to Cairo would be relaitvely easy apart the
weather. I would be taking a train from here to Wadi Halfa, then from
Halfa to Aswan Egypt there is a ferry. Once in Egypt there are all
forms of transportatio available.  But it would take at least 5 days
just to get to Aswan. and another 1 or 2 days from there to Cairo.

<P>I don't know, it's just that this flu I just got over kind of
demoralized me a little: I feel physically a lot more vulnerable,
since I got sick twice on this jouorney already. Time is running up. I
think I should just fly. Plus if I fly, I can get to see the Meroe
Pyramids, which I have already paid for. Becasue today is Sunday, and
yesterday I didn't go buy the tickets becase I was not feeling well.

<P>The schedule was: Saturday buy train and ferry tickets. Sunday go
with bus to Meroe pyramids. Sleep there out on the desert by the
pyramids. Monday morning hitch a ride down to Kabushyia, and hop on
the train there. But with this flu, the whole schedule si screwed up,
which means that if I want to go to Cairo via surface, I have to give
up Meroe. Or, wait another week and be in Cairo in 2 weeks, which is
not an option.

<P>• Did I write about "photo medicine" mentioned by Florian in Addis?

<P>• Here tea from glass water from cup

<P>• $181+20 to cairo egypt air

<P>• Boy Scout meeting.

<P>• Excitment at 21:15 when the TX volume suddenly dies, and everyone
stomrs towards the shore. There is a man in the blue nile that needs
to be saved. One of our members goes out and rescues him. Apparently
it's a stupid fuck who thought he could kill himself by jumping off
the blue nile bridge, just 800m upstream from here. Of course he
didn't know what the man that was taking to philip told us yesterday,
and that was that he used to jump off that bridgewhen he was a kid all
the time and then floaty in the nile until he reached the sailing
club. The whole ride was like 4-5 minutes long. It wqas great, he
said. But the rescued man was not so happy. Everyone was laughing, he
wans't. He got a cigarette from somebody as he entered Williamms
office, here at the blue nile. Wjat is his faith going to be like now? 
Sha-Allah.

<P>• Today was flight day. I got a ride to the airport (I knew I could
get one from somebody here at the sailing club) but it was early, like
10pm. My flight leaves at 6am, and check in is at 3am. So I have 5
hours to kill at the airport. The italian book does a very good job of
keeping me busy, with it's emotional, yet often sad, with much lack of
communication (I wonder if the author is doing it on purpose by
descrbing such a tight friendship where communicatino is just lost in
a situation of shared feelings fora girl...)
