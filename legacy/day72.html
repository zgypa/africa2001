    <h1>Day 72 - Khartoum, Sudan</h1>
    <h2>Saturday August 4<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>
    

    <p>Shueia = little (tnisr-tnish in amharic)<br> Tanam = good</p>
    
    <P>19:10 The Sun is about to set on the Blue Nile. Khartoum is the
    city in Sudan where the Blue Nile meets the White Nile to form
    "The Nile", as we and the Egyptians know it. The sky is clear
    (what a surprise for the rainy season, but in Khartoum also the
    rainy season doesn't yield too much water), and the Sun is know
    half light orange, and half red-orange. It's got some line of
    clouds around it so that it looks like Saturn. But where exactly
    am I, really? Great Sunset. In the background Wimbledon 2001, or
    some sort of athletics olympics. But I know that the paradise will
    soon be over. As the susets, those Malaria-infested mosquitos will
    come out, but here by the Nile there are billions of them, so they
    say, because I have not slept here yet. But if one forgets about
    Malaria, (and one needs to do so in a place like this, although it
    is difficult at first. It comes natural to think of this place as
    Africa, and not as, oh say nature. But I have to compare all these
    things with what I am used to seeing.). Now the sun is like a
    moon, or the Full Moon, red and wrapped by the fog and humidity
    created by the Nile. The Moon has not risen yet though, which
    makes me once again wonder about that phenomenon that I have heard
    so many times: When you can't distinguish the Moon from the
    Sun.</p>

    <P>Today I arrived in Khartoum by bus, a bus which was not the
    best bus, the famous El Saf-saf, but was a bus that cost me 1600
    dinar, which is about $6.40, but it was an italian bus, and it
    looked and felt like a Greyhound. We all had numbered seats
    (unheard of around here but also around the States), and only 4
    seats per row, unlike the other, say Ethiopian, buses, where
    there were 5 passangers per row.</p>

    <P>I decided ot stay at the Blue Nile sailing club, where I could
    camp for $3/nite.  But when I got off the bus, the taxi drivers
    where giving me the prices in Sudanese pounds, but I was counfused
    for a minute, and thought it was in dinar (funny because I knew
    about this problem), so they were asking me for 10,000 Sudanese
    pounds, which is now equal to 1,000 dinar, which is an OK
    price. But I laughed at them, when they told me 10,000, also
    because a) the bus ride from Gedaref to Khartoum (which takes like
    the 4-5 hours) costed 6-7 times less, and b) I didn't even have
    that much (10,000dinar) on me!</p>

    <P>I got to the city with a minibus having carried all my stuff to
    the minibus in the sun, which was hot. I was then able to follow
    the lonely planet map of the city and find my way around to the
    Ministry of Tourism and Agricolture. Here I got travel permit, and
    zeroxs thereof,. Tomorrow I have to go register at the Immigration
    or whatever it's called here. I also have to do internet, but most
    importantly I have to call AmEx to cancel the stolen travellers
    checks, which were stolen from Muluye Bekele Kassa, PO Box 120,
    Bahar Dar, Ethiopia. I guess I will send him a post card and ask
    him what he did with all that material he stole from me.</p>

    <P>Today I drank a lot of Soda. It's like it's hot, and the only
    thing you crave for is soda, which of course does not satisfy your
    thirst, because it's too sweet. But I went to a bar or rather
    little food store across the street from the sailing club and they
    had me try the so called (btw, the name of the apple soda was
    <b>Stim</b>, by Pepsi, and here in Sudan it seems that Pepsi took
    over) <b>Ardeb</b>, which is a cold tea made out of these sort of
    beans that are bitter, but also sweet and sticky and you can suck
    them, and they give this Ardeb flavour for a long time. The
    flavour seems to be on the outside of the shell and to be a very
    thick water-soluble layer. The plant grows only in South Sudan,
    where there is war. And it's not because of the war that it grows
    there, just in case you were wondering.</p>

    <P>But by ending up in Sudan I fainlly reached a civilized place:
    people here have respect for you and for themselves. There are no
    beggars, or rather, no more than there are in Italy, and if
    somebody says hi to you on the street they won't start following
    you. Now I have the proof that it must not be that way. And
    Khartoum is absolutely fantastic: it has a lot of Africa with
    little tarmac streets, and mud huts in the outisde (just like
    Gedaref), but then somehow the people that live in it are not
    African, or at[...]</p>
