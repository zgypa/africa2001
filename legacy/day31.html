      Tomorrow Oki is going to Masai-Mara national park for free, instead of paying 
      $50/day plus $17/day park fees, which totals $280. I was thinking of going with 
      him, but I think I should not. Just a few hours ago I was thinking while taking 
      a dump that I don't want to leave this country with the impression that I have 
      seen it and don't want to come back. I just want to get that "oh, yes, I've 
      travelled through Africa, but didn't see much. yes I met some people, but I 
      would be glad to go again and cover more interesting places". I would like to 
      come back with Mec and Jeff...
    </P>
    <P>
      So today was pretty boring: just sitting around at the camp doing little, like 
      playing caroom and pool. Night finally came and it was time to eat. They were 
      showing James Bond The world is not enough on TV. Pretty nice. Then, all of a 
      sudden, Smiley noticed some blood on the floor: itwas one of the dogs, Fire, 
      who was bleeding from her leg. So Brandon, the owner, was promptly called, but 
      he was having dinner and did not want to be disturbed. There was a lot of 
      tension now at the camp site. People didn't like the way Brandon just didn't 
      come back to ttake care of the problem.
    </P>
    <P>
      One lady tried to medicate the wound by wrapping it with some medical gauze, 
      but she didn't tie it tight enough, so she didn't stop the bleedingat all. 
      Fortunately, at the same time, another man wa tryig to find soe vet and 
      succeeded. Fire was taken to the vet and the vet said that 1 artery and 2 veins 
      were cut by probably some form of knife. At this point, when the barlady 
      translated these words from swahili to English, the camp site entered alarm 
      mode Domebody is trying to brake in and is damaging/hurting the dogs. So the 
      guards armed themselves with their strong, and dangerous bow and arrow, and 
      went around the site to check ifsomebody was there. But they didnt' find 
      anybody. In the menawhile, James Bond continued on the screen and eventually 
      finished. I was kind of scaredthat if someone was braking in, I might be the 
      one to suffer the most since I was the only tent pitched on the lawn. And the 
      lady barlady was teling me not to say these hings, that it's just silly. So hen 
      I asked why she loooked worried, and she said that if they brake in she might 
      bery well be the firwsst one to go, since they will want to come inside and 
      raid the office. So I laughedand recongized this behaviour as a characteristic 
      female one. and asked her about it, but she just laughed and said nothing.
    </P>
    <P>
      I finally decided to have the last beer and go to bed, when The purfect Murder 
      came on. So I watched a little of it, but it was too holliwood, so I finally 
      decided to go to bed. At this time, Oki was developing a new theory about the 
      cut leg: Since there are no blood traces on the floor outside, maybe she got 
      hurt inside with something sharp. This would eliminate the brake in danger 
      which, they thaought, was threatening them. I slept in the tent and all went 
      all right.
