      Day 24 - Dar es Salaam, Tanzania

    <P>
      Only this morning I realized how nice of a night last night
      was. As we are travelling more and more to the north, the
      temperatures get hotter and hotter. this past night was not as
      good as the last one, bacause we kept on stopping. Dean was
      telling me that we probably covered 5 miles the whole night. He
      was trying to sleep on a chair at the bar, because after having
      attempted to sleep in the lounge, and having being kicked out,
      he even got locked out of his cabin, while his girlfriend, Joe,
      who was in a different one, got in hers, and slept.

      And the journey started to get long. And we were supposed to be
      in Dar es Salaam at 15, but then it quicky became 16, then 18,
      then 20:30, but then the locomotive brokedown like 1 hour before
      arrival. Luckily, the engineers were able to repair, and we only
      lost about 30 minutes or maybe one hour.
    </P>
    <P>
      I calculated the trip to have lasted about 54 hours (excluding loco brakedown) 
      and the distance covered was about 1800km, which makes our average velocity 
      33.3km/h. That's about 20mph. If I biked it, without stopping, it would 
      probably take me that long.... Oh well, but it was great.
    </P>
    <P>
      Arriving in Dar es Salaam (Haven of Peace, Arab) was also great. The four of us 
      decided to take a cab together to this hotel called Zanzibar Hotel, reccomended 
      by a Dutch to Dean. Getting off the train was crazy: it looked like people 
      exiting the stadium after a football match. The train had about 20 wagons by 
      the time we got to Dar (it kept on getting longer and longer along the way) and 
      3rd class was packed, I mean packed, a tiny little more than Italian train 
      packing, in that this one was a 2.5 days packed journey, not a few hours one.
    </P>
    <P>
      So I inevitably lost my party, which I found back again just before the exit to 
      wild Dar. The "taxi driver" first tried to put all in the trunk, but my backpack 
      would not fit, so I sat in front with it, and they squished inthe back. The car 
      started, but the experinced travelers noticed that the trunk was not able to 
      shut properly and were scared that somebody might walk by at a traffic light 
      and just steal the lot. The driver, of course, insister that it was OK, but we 
      stopped, took all the luggage inside the car and proceeded with the back seats 
      that looked like a pile of lggage. I mean, not that it wasn't, but what I am 
      trying to sayis that the passangers were totally covered by them luggages.
    </P>
    <P>
      So we arrived to the Zanzibar Hotel, but it was totally full, so we tried 
      another one, which was full too. People were crowding up around our car 
      suggesting first this hotel, then this other. Eventually we were able to find a 
      place by following this duded who apparently worked at the hotel, and said it 
      was around the corner. Well, in fact it was: first we had to cross the street, 
      alkt between building on dirt roads, then on the main steet again, then bhind a 
      builiding. And sure enought, the place existed. I was very sceptical about the 
      existance of this hotel, but in fact it'snot too bad. Again the expertese of 
      who has been travelling for 6 month can be seen.
    </P>
    <P>
      I was very surprised at how they were moving fast: See, when I find myself in 
      such sitations, where you are pressured to find a place to stay, I used to move 
      really fast too. But then I read the Douglas Adams hitchiker's Guide to the 
      Galaxy and learned "don't Panic". And from that moment, I started moving 
      slower, the more I am in trouble. See, the slower you move, the more in control 
      you are but not only of your movements, but of movements of others. You have 
      time to scan left and right and knowwhere everybody is. It is a lot harder for 
      someone to pop out of nowhere, or for you to trip onto something.
    </P>
    <P>
      But the brits didn't seem to know about Adams, altough they grew up ij the same 
      nation.

      I took a shoewr, ate some granola bars and will go to bed now... 6/18/01 0:26
