<h1>Day 56 - Mekele, Ethiopia</h1>
<h2>Thursday July 19<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>


<p>
Wait for bus

<p>
Horrible sleep wth all sort of insects around me,
although I was super precaucious. I mean, I don't have any deet or
stuff like that, but I tried to put layers, like jacket, sweater and
sleeping bag between me and the bed, but that did not help. I still
got bitten a lot. By now I have tons and tons of bites. So I slept
very poorly. Dan and his friend slept on the floor in front of the
room. On thermarests. They probably slept better than I did. In fact,
I woke up 1 hour earlier then they did.

<p>
But we have to find a bus or some sort of ride. The Land Cruiser that
this dude (broker) said he found didn't happen. The dude was not to be
seen. The first bus drives by, but it's full. So is the second. This
time it is trickier to get onn the bus, since the buses for the north
don't depart from here, but they come directly from Dessi or Addis, so
they have passengers on them already.

<p>
We tried to entertain the 30-40 kids/people that were around us for a
while. Dan was even trying to charge them some money to sit there and
look, and one kid paid. He paid like some 5 cents, and dan allowed him
to watch for 30 minutes. Of course this was all a joke. But I think it
was at this point that Dan started to think that he had to pull of a
scam. He wanted to be able to rip off some Ethiopian, some evil
one. Just to get back to them, since they always try to rip you off.

<p>
It turned out that the kid wanted the money back, so Dan gave him back
a 10cents instead. He wanted to keep the 5 cents as a reminder, as a
souvenir of the situation: he was able to get a local to give him 5
cents.

<p>
But then we decided to go sit at the bar across the street, while
waiting for the bus, so we could have breakfast in the meanwhile. And
it was a very pleasent bar, and as we sit, we meet the Italian guy
that worked there, Cristiano Scaramella, from Napels. He is a tall
skinny guy, and seems pretty friendly. We order some eggs and coffee
and he tells us a little bit of his situation. He is going back soon,
in a couple of weeks. He has 2 daughters, who are pretty young. Then
dan asked if it was dangerous to talk about the government, and he
hinted that it was. Then he invited us over for dinner, if we were to
get stuck in Woldia.  Maybe he wants to talk to us in a more private
scene?

<p>
He paid for our coffee and soon left. whe appered to be very busy. We
waited longer for another bus, but that one was also full. Then a Land
Cruiser said they could take us up, but for a very expensive price. We
decidedjust to do it, but we had to wait for them to fix a tire.
During the wait, bus number 4 stopped by and this one was going all
the way up to Adigrat. So we decided to hop on it. And we finally
started moving.

<p>
The ride was long, and we were late, very late, to be able to get to
Mekele today. On the bus I met this guy who studied in Germany for 8
years. He told me to call him if I got stuck in Addis, that he would
show me around with his car a little.

<p>
So, after all the bus ride started being OK. I was sitting next to
these two ladies, who, for some odd reason, made nme feel cozy. There
was a positive atmosphere in the bus. The ladies were passing this kid
aroud to themselves, then to the guy who studied in Germany and all
was good.

<p>
I found out from a guy on the bus that the driver wanted to get to
Mekele that same night only around 4-5pm. But we were still 4 hours
away from Mekele. That meant we would have not arrived before 8 or
9pm, and I was exhausted already. The road was pretty dangerous, going
up and down mountains... And then it got dark. And the strom started
to kick in. And soon enough, we were exactly inside the storm, just
inthe middle of it. That was on hell of an experience. It was
lightning like 3-4 times a second, and pouring down rain. The driver
could barely see, but he continued. Luckily the road was flat now, and
there was no up and down climbing.

<p>
We arrived to Mekele exhausted.

<p>
Red Alert! Attention, attention: Dan ran out of the room, here at this
luxury hotel were we are paying $24, to see if there is spaghetti on
the floor. Why? We ordered, so they ordereed from the restaurant next
door. Then, 30 minutes later, we hear a bi noise from outside. And 5
minutes after that, a phone call to our room saying that spaghetti are
finished andtherefore are yellem (not avaliable). So that is when Dan
went outside. Of course we already payd for the food, so I wonder what
is going on now... better go check myself.

<p>
But more fun was inflicted to us by the TV which was showing three
channels only: ETV (ethiopian TV), CNN and CCTV (China Central
TV). Now, CNN had no sound on all 3-4 frequencies they were on (I
tried to retune the TV), ETV had poor quality, but CCTV was
perfect. And they were showing some pretty hilarious stuff. The
comunist propaganda was bending a lot of news, while a lot of other
shows and dances were directly organzed by the government. The
government was basically deciding what the Chinese tradiational dances
were, and how to modernize them.
