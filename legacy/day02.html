      Day 02 - Shannon, Ireland

    <P>
      I am happy to be in Europe.

    <P>
      I Landed, went through the passport check and customs, no problem. Then I tried 
      to call Molly, and I was always getting the London area code wrong, so I kept 
      on getting to this bank... Eventually she told me to come over in the 
      afternoon, that she told David she wouldn't go with him, I don't know where. So 
      I figured I needed money, and exchanged $100 (at the 1.481 rate), and then I 
      boarded the bus. All this took me 20mins. Once I get to Limmerick I will take a 
      bus to Dublin where I will arrive at 13:00.
    <P>
      Limmerick, I don't know much about it, but the bus station really. There is a 
      bar/pub which serves some irish beans, which I ordered with something to drink, 
      which I think was beer. I started to notice how the number of ladies is a lot 
      greater here than in any other places I have been to.
