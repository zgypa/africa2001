      So waking up around 10:30 does not help someone want to leave
      early. But that was OK as well. I was able to finish talking to
      Mike, since he decided to stay in and not go to work, and was
      trying to help Steve work the brand new scanner, purchased the
      day before. Then eventually, it started to be close to 1PM, and
      I knew I wanted to be in Eastleigh at around 2PM so I started to
      get nervous.  and I was nervous not only because of the
      time. It was mainly because I did not want to leave.
    </P>

<i>This is what Mike told me just before leaving. He was telling me these
things just before I left. Since he came from north, and was going
south, he could tell me were to go to stay, and how much to pay and
who to talk to in some towns.

      Mike was making fun of me, which was a good thing. He was making
      fun of my ideals, and of how I had packed. As a matter of fact,
      he is right: my ideals are not ideal for this kind of
      traveling, and my packing is also not ideal for like go around
      and visit sort of travel. Just to see things, it is a very good
      idea to have a sleeping bag, some clothes, medication kit, and
      beauty case.  That's it. All the rest is way too much. Also the
      tent is too much in a continent like this, where you can
      find hotel rooms for 2USD/night.. Unless you wanna go out in
      nature and camp, but then you also need a guide of some sort)having
      a tent is just a big heavy thing. Not advisable. Also the
      cooking stuff. I have the impression that I am not going to need
      it. I might need it this summer back in Italy, but not for the
      moment., down there, where I am traveling from one city to the
      next. Yes I decided to just travel and not see.  I don't' feel
      packed properly for seeing and driving around. Also, I do not
      have the time to do so. I mean, we all know I could take the
      time, but I prefer not to. I want to spend time in Italy, and my
      goal on this trip was to travel north, to go home via land, so
      that is what I should be doing. Then I also have to stop in
      Israel, so I better hit the road.
    </P>

      After all this thinking, I get my stuff ready, and prepare to hop on a cab and 
      go to Eastleigh to catch a truck to Moyale. Everyone was telling me that this 
      was going to be the hard part of the trip, but I wasn't not scared outside, 
      rather I was scared inside.
    </P>
    <P>
      Once in Eastleigh, I find a truck, hop on it, and pay 1000Ksh to
      stay on the top, with the cargo, which happened to be a
      shit-load of school notebooks. After having waited for about 1
      hour for a tire to arrive, a new one that is, we finally leave,
      and stop at the gas station where the driver gets convinced by
      the rowdy (a kid that works for the truck driver, and takes care
      of all the minute things like cleaning up, , changing tires, and
      such) to change the tire before we leave for Isiolo, so we
      do. In the process of changing it, somehow, the air tube gets
      pinched. The theory is that the rowdy screwed up and pinched the
      tube while putting it in. But I don't think this is what
      happened: the tube was not pinched where you would think the
      rowdy could have pinched it. I think they tire was sole with a
      an air tube that was already pinched. At any rate, we wasted
      about 4 hours at the gas station, because of this tire. The
      truck equipage was very incompetent, and were doing most things
      wrong, braking a a few valves of the air tube, and other things.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then we finally took off. and the trip to Isiolo was OK, but
      very cold. The road was a tarmac (as they say here) road, and we
      ended up sleeping in a dodgy hotel in Isiolo. I got many many
      cold, much of it, because there were too many people on the
      truck and my stuff was behind all of them. As I didn't want to
      disturb them, I didn't go for my stuff. But I soon felt the
      consequences of this decision as I caught a cold.
    </P>
    <P>
      But the bed was OK, a small room, looked like a jail cellar, and
      I sort of slept OK, but I knew I could not sleep long since we
      were going to take off at 6am.
