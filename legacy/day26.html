      Day 26 - Zanzibar (boat)
    </H1>
    <H2>
      Tuesday June 19<SUP>th</SUP>, 2001
    </H2>
    <P>
      Today I woke up in the bed, by the Norvegian, whom I told to
      wake me up in the morning. I had breakfast with them, then I
      started to play Bao with Adam, who was teaching me how to
      play. I immediately wanted a board myself, so I decided to buy
      one. myself. Then packed my stuff and checked out, with a damage
      of like 44USD. The beach in this place was absolutely
      marvelous. Ladies were always on it collecting see weed to
      export to the Japanese, who like to eat it.
    </P>
    <P>
      I was basically waiting for Adam to be ready, so we cold
      go. This didn't happened until after lunch,though. And when he
      said we were ready to go, I asked if we wanted to smoke some
      ganja, so we went and did it on the beach. But it was a lot,
      and he ended up not smoking any, basically. So i had to do it
      all. or almost, and was smashed, then we walked to the dala-dala
      stop, and that was very hard, maybe because when you are stoned
      your heart is racing quite a bit, and maybe also because it was
      very hot, and I had to carry the heavy backpack and such.
    </P>
    <P>
      At any rate, at tee bus top we met this guy, who seemed to be
      one of Adams buddies, and the started talking in Swahili, and I
      was going crazy, as the language was tripping me out: it
      sounded like Genuese, or Portugese, but I couldn't understand a
      word (not that I can understand a word of Genuese or Portugese,
      but the point was that it sounded very familiar , yet it was
      very distant). I could relate with their expressions, and
      Adams buddy said that from the way I laugh he sometimes thinks
      that I understand what they are saying, and I replied that wen
      I laugh it's because I think I understand too.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then we hopped on the back of the pickup truck with seats and
      roof, I mean on the dala-dala, and headed off for the city of
      Zanzibar. The ride was silent. i was just really stoned and
      looking outside at the vegetation that , as it was winter, it
      was all green, like intensely dense and green. And I thought
      to myself:"thank god it's Winter! In the summer how is it? Like
      you have to leave because the vegetation just takes over?" But
      then again I was stoned, so I don't know how much this was
      important thought.
    </P>

<caption align="bottom"><I>These are the rules for the Game of Bao,
which I have purchased today with Adam in Zanzibar. I have written the
rules myself, and, since they are quite complicated, I have probably
forgotten something here and there. But I wrote them immediately, so I
would not forget. If somebody has the exact rules, please email me at

      Once in the city, we get off at the port, to go buy the
      ticket. I decided not to stay another night on the island, and
      instead to save money and ride the ferry at night. That way I
      get 2 pigeons with one stone: a place to stay, and the ferry
      all for $25.
    </P>
    <P>
      We headed for a beer. On the way, I got convinced by a street
      bum to buy another elephant tail hair bracelet (which was used)
      for 1000Tsh. Then we stopped for the beer in stone town, which
      is just like our old city in Genova, maybe smaller, with the
      streets better maintained, or less old. We stopped at a bar ,
      just in front of a bureau of change, that I mistakenly did not
      use, and i bought Adam some 3 beers, gave him 1000Tsh, just
      because I had "lots of them", and gave him 2000Tsh, so he could
      buy a chicken alive, for his family. I was in fact going to buy
      him some food at the bar, but then he thought about it, and told
      me just to give him 2000Tsh, that way he can buy the chicken,
      and I can still have some change for the night ferry.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then he started to talk about what I should do and that I am now
      on my own, and should therefore watch it. He basically preached
      and told me what an idiot I had been with the rastafarian (I had
      told him the story while at the beach smoking), and how I just
      wasted another 1000Tsh for the street guy. He talked ant talked,
      and I was silent, had nothing to say. He also told me about his
      salary, and how it is not enough, and never will be enough. I
      was trying to tell him that also when it is enough, people here
      can't save, because the rest of the family comes to collect it,
      but this seemed to be a thought that he didn't too much pick up
      , as he was mainly concerned about my safety. He wanted me to
      call once I get to Arusha.
    </P>
    <P>
      I was very touched by this conversation. He was talking to me
      like a parent of family friend, giving me advices and telling me
      stories that are just like the ones somebody who loves you would
      give you.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then we went for a walk. He decided he would walk with me back
      to the port, as he thought I would get lost, or so something
      stupid again. On the way we had some kebab sort of thing, for
      100Tsh each, and it was great. Very good. Then he departed, and
      went home. I turned around and headed back toward the port, at
      the ticket counter, were I had left my luggage.
    </P>
    <P>
      I sat on the curb, next to some street people, this time aware
      of what they were and who they wanted (or the other way around
      but it works both ways). The one guy next to me on the right was
      clearly tripping on heroin. They obviously started a
      conversation, and I was chill about it all. After a while, I
      decided to have a smoke, and as soon as I pulled out the
      tobacco, they swarmed.  Everyone wanted a smoke, so I started
      rolling, and rolled like 4 or 5 cigarettes, and then called it
      quits. and said no to the others. I recognized one guy who
      seemed to be nice in the group, he was Arabic, ad he was
      actually the on who suggested to stop rolling by saying out
      loud"OK last one guys, last one for everyone!" and I agreed. We
      all had the smoke, then I asked at the counter if it was time to
      bard, she said yes, and I went in to pick up my backpack, dropped
      they 12V stabilized 3Amp transformer, and headed for boarding.
    </P>
    <P>
      The boat trip was very nice: they put us in the VIP lounge,
      basically all the tourists, with some kids that were friends of
      who worked there. I met the tourists, who were two couples, one
      from England, this guy who came down to work for 6 months, and
      now is sort of traveling back to his research city, which I
      think was Arusha, but I am not certain. The other couple, he was
      South African, and she was Californian. He had climbed the
      Kilimanjaro last year and paid $900 for it. And we started
      hanging out and playing the Bao game. Then some locals saw us
      play and were watching and started to correct as were making
      mistakes in rules and moves. So then I played with one of them
      and the game lasted for ever, but AI won. then they played
      against each other and it lasted a lot less. Then I rolled one
      and 3 of us went outside and smoked it.  Then I threw or better
      flicked the  but in the wind and the wind caught it, and it
      started accelerating more and going further, and The one guy said
      [something]-colea! Which they didn't know how to explain, so I
      insisted, and it turned out to be acceleration. So then I whipped
      out that acceleration was the measure of gravity and stepped into
      a whole new world of conversation: Up until now They didn't know
      what acceleration, measure or gravity meant. so I started to
      explain. Measure was easy, gravity a little less, but I think they
      got it pretty well. I also explained to them that acceleration is
      measure in m/s^2, and what that meant and they seemed to get it
      pretty well. . Then ti was late and we went to bed. In the VIP
      lounge with air conditioning and mattress on the floor.
