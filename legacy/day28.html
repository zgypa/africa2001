      Day 22 - Arusha, Tanzania
    </H1>

      Thursday June 21<SUP>st</SUP>, 2001
    </H2>
    <P>
      Today I basically chilled. I didn't know what to do, because yesterday I just 
      went to bed without planning. I woke up around 11am, wrote the last 3 days of 
      this book, and organized somethings, fixed my pouch, and finally at almost 1pm 
      I went for lunch and breakfast and started to see how I could get out of there 
      and move on. The plan was not too bad: go down town, buy a ticket on a shuttle 
      bus, ad leave. And since I was in town, I could have also done some iternet and 
      exchange some money.
    </P>
    <P>
      The guy I met yesterday and talked about physics, he was apparently part of 
      this safari group, and was waiting for his group to get back. I saw hime today, 
      as he was preparing dinner for the group, that still had not arrived.
    </P>
    <P>
      When the group came back, one guy started talking to me and saying how there 
      are to groups and some people are going to Dar the next day and some are not. 
      Then I started putting in the drawing book the rules for the bao game. As it 
      turns out, they guy I had just met was called Bill and today was Bill;s 
      birthday, and the game I was writing rules for I ended up playing with Zachery (
      <A HREF="http://www.mountkilimanjaro.com">
        http://www.mountkilimanjaro.com
      </A>
      )which made me live through quite an interstig experince.
    </P>
    <H3>
      Zach
    </H3>
    <P>
      Zachery, in fact, as you can see from his webiste, is 34 and has a few kids. He 
      first started to be a priest. But soon God made his future turn around, and he 
      quickly became a mount kilimanjaro guide climber. Then one day he met these 
      americans, a couple, that were very intersted in him and believed in him. So 
      they wanted to help him start his business. After climbing the mountain with 
      him, they went back to america, and the amiericans assisted and sponsoerd his 
      business: they fist send some money for the office, then some for computers, 
      and Zach slowly built up a name in the internet too, being served by the 
      american friends.
    </P>
    <P>
      One daythe ameridcand decided to go back to Tanzania to see how Zach had spent 
      the money. When they saw that the business was atualy there, they were 
      surprised but happy.
    </P>
    <P>
      We played bao together and as we were playing I started having serious doubts 
      about the rules, as I fierd.
    </P>
    <P>
      The night then proceeded with Zach being extremely drung on cffee and double 
      whisky ( he had 7 ov them) and payed some for some ladies, and half one for me, 
      andd at the time of paying the bill, he was giving Adolfa very har time. That 
      was funny adn interesting the ways Adolf was looking at him, knwoing that he 
      had money, and was just extremely patient. Then one of the Englishmen came to 
      apy too, and this guy was eady forsome serious bargaining. Being to drunk, ahe 
      was obviously unableto see that that wwas a place were you could not bargain, 
      attt the most he could get a discount, since the ir group was very big. So the 
      bartender gave him a discount, but the man insisted more and more and wanted to 
      drop the price. But Adoolf could not bend, because he knew that any more 
      discount than what he gave already, it would have had to come out of his 
      pocket. Eventually th drunk Englishman payed and left.

      After all this I went to bed.
