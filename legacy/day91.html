    <h1>Day 91 - Jerusalem, Israel</h1>
<h2>Thursday August 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2001</h2>

<P>see Jerusalem & dei.

<P>• most useful items used:
      <ol>
	<li>Jungle boots (Tom Mayfield)
	  <li>3L. Water Jug (Mani Pierce)
	    <LI>Leather Jacket (godmother)
      </ol>

<P>• Today we went out to the Dead Sea, had a bathe in the
water. Amazing. You just float, just like you see on TV or in the
pictures. As soon as you are standing in one foot deep water you can
feel it already. It's like the water is pushig you up more, you are
lighter. Then, when you are in, if you don't pay attention, you turn
around very easily, especially if you are not straight with your
back. And if you get the salt in your eyes, it's trouble. The burn
just wont go away, like it does in sea water. It just stays. Yougotta
go out and rinse in the boiling hot showers. I mean, you have to
realize that this beach is in the middle of the desert, so it's kind
of like an oases. And have you ever tried to taste it? Have you? Well,
it's very salty. Like, extremely salty. Like, you coulnd't even boil
pasta in it, because it's too salty. They say it's 10 times saltier
than sea water.

<P>When you get out and take a shower, and then dry off, your skin
feels very soft, and you are clean. All that dirt that had accumulated
under your nails is now gone. And all the bruses, well they burnn
quite a bit when you are in the water, but then they are clean
again. And your hair too. All clean. It's weird. But very cool.

<P>Then we had dinner in this restaurant, which seemed to have a good
deal for the meal, like 44 shekels for a soup, a main course, and a
coffee. Which was OK, cuz if you bought them all seperately, it would
have cost you like maybe 70 shekels.  But when I asked him about the
44nis menu, he said, of course, that it was only for lunch.

<P>Then there was this girl, wiatress, sort of young, showing her
belly with a tight top (everyone wares tight tops here, this
year. Even the ugly girls. Only if they have really small breasts, do
they wear a looser shirt), and everytime I would look at her to get
her attention because I needed service, she would look at me as if I
looked at her because I liked her. Then Guy pointed out that maybe she
looks at me that way because she likes me. That was a good point I
hadn't thought about.

<P>The other waitress, instead, wearing tight pants and shirt, had a
much more beautiful body. She was maybe in her mid teens, and was
walking in such a way, that I could have hired her as a model for my
clothes, had I been a fashion designer. She just knew it. She knew she
was good, and she just did it all the way. When she walked past my
table the first time, she left an aura of top model, that i couldn't
do anything else then laugh. I thought that if all the hot girls are
like that, then I should have no problem (chigr yellem) in picking one
up.

<P>Then we got the bill, which included service, but as the waiter
said, it didn't include tip. So we, and the table next to use,
concluded that he was trying to get more money from us, and concluded
that service was tip.

<P>So then we went to the mini supermarket and had a flash back of how
it was to do shoppig with Guy in the good old Cleveland days. We got
stuck, like as usual: I propose something, he is not covinced, so I
let go, and let him decided. But he is not ready for that, he just
expressed that he was not convinced with what I had decided. Then he
suggests something, or asks for some quality of cookies to buy. I look
at him, and I really don't care, so I tell him. He gets stuck again,
and doesn't know what to buy. So we end up walkig up and down the
supermarket for hours. This time, though, he was good at recongizeing
how it would go (he was faster than me), so we decided to decide 50%
each,in terms of items. So I decided the liquer, and he decided the
munchies. Then we bought some candels too.


<P>We asked the cashier guy where we could find some peace and look at
the stars. He told us to go behind the hilton, but we both agreed that
would not be a good place, so Guy drove in the inland, away from the
dead sea. Some 20-30km in, he pulls up in this drive way that goes
100m off the road, then we get our stuff, and start walking up a small
hill. The moon was still up and it was going down. it was about
10pm. I really wanted to go in the desert and see the stars, but I
wanted to go were the desert was flat, all flat, and no cities. The
place were we went wasn't bad, I mean we had plenty of sky view, and
the moon was setting. The only problem was that we had about 6-7
city/towns within a 30-40km radius, and we could see their lights
leaking into the dark sky, washing out the stars in that corner. But
for Israel, I think it was a good place. I should have done some
starwatching in Egypt. Israel is too small.

<P>And we stayed there, and open the wine bottle, and talked and
drank, and discovered a way of lying on my full size therma-rest in
two (which I had failed to find when with Corina some 2 years ago),
and we talked about life, meditation, and what to do and what not. And
we talked about what had been done, and I told him some Cleveland
stories. Then, at around 1or 2am we decided to head back towards the
car, because we were getting cold (it was very windy on that hill) and
tired. So we work our way down, and soon realize that the moonlight
would have been nice to have. We also realize how Guy's idea
(suppressed by me) of buying another flashlight was a really good
one. I forgot that you need one flashlight per person. And we went
down, me first, because I am more confident in going down than I am in
going up, and because I had boots, while he only had sandals. So I
would go down a few feet, then I would stop and make light for
him. And we went on like that for a while, and making decisions on
where we came from. We were getting less and less secure about the
path. We were starting to getting paranoid. We were about to freak
out, and we knew it. But we didn't say a word about it. We knew that
we could just walk to the road, and then we would find the car from
there. And that's what we ended up doing at the end. On the way, I was
thinking of how when you get lost, you always miss your target by jus
a few feet. And then guy found the car. We had passed it by about 100m
and missed it by maybe 5m. It was a relieve. We werent' tired anymore,
but were suddenly aware of all the sweat that we had accumulated. We
drove back to Jerusalem, with Guy trying to fight his tiredness by
talking constantly.
