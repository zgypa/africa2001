<caption align="bottom"><i>Harrington is a nice fellow. He was working
as a security guard, but wanted to go to university. He didn't have
much dough, though, and could not afford to. We talked and talked, and
had a great time, but when we hit religion, unfortunately, there was
nothing to do. Harrington is very religous and believes in God and
Christ in an almost fanatic way. The people here are brought up that
way, and there is not much one can do. Their view of the earth, life
and big-bang is totally biblical: "There once was Adam and Eve...".

    <p>Something but not much happened in the past days. I have not
    written any entries, simply because life was pretty much normal. I
    was staying at this house, the Mathur's mansion, and all went
    well. Not too often did we leave the "royal" walls.</p>

    <p>What I did do of interest was get to know Harrington, the night
    time security guard of the house. And in doing so, I also drew
    him.

<caption align="bottom">The Kite <i>is a very obvious constellation
that rotates around the sky at nite, and one can see it pretty much
everywhere across the southern hemisphere. I have heard that it can be
seen in the Northern one too, at some points of the year, if you are
closer to the equator. It seems to creep up there at times...<br>

The other constellation, the </I>Caterpillar<i>, was the one that
Aneesh found. And he also wrote a poem for this beautiful night
sitting outside, watching stars in Zambia.

    <p>Another activity of these days was an attempt to sketch some
    constellations in the sky. I had this goal of giving names to all
    the constellations, since I couldn't find anyone who knew them
    already, or who could tell me how this southern sky was. So i came
    up with one that I had been looking at for the past couple of days
    already, and Aneesh came up with an even more complex one. He is
    good. I would have never seen that one.

    <P>
      Aneesh and Mani decided to give me a ride to New Kapiri-Mposhi,
      which is where the Tanzania-Zambia Railway station is. This
      railway was built buy the Chinese in 1977, and they still use
      the same trains. His mother came along too. Before leaving
      Lusaka, I had to purchase the train ticket, since, the day
      before, when I got to the office, at about 15:45, they were
      already closed. When I got there, at abut 9:15, the man said
      pointing at the watch: "Didn't we agree that you would come at
      8:30? You are not going to make to Kapiri! The train leaves at
      12.30!" "I'm driving" I replied firmly. "How much for a first
      class ticket?"  "That's not what we agreed on!". He was
      referring to the conversation we had the previous day, where I
      was merely asking questions. Eventually he stuck his hand out
      from under the window and waited. "What?" I asked. "Student ID"
      he said. I gave him that. He looked at it, put it back on the
      counter where he found it, then stuck his hand out
      again. "What?" I asked. "Money" he said. "How much?" "Oh, right,
      K85,000", which is about $25 for a 1800km stretch. I was
      realizing that I was not responding well to his arrogant
      behavior. I was trying to be arrogant back, but then in this
      case it was pretty pointless, because it would mean loosing. If
      I wouldn't have bought the ticket there, I would have just made
      my life harder.
    </P>
    <P>
      I took the ticket and jumped in the car. Then a boy called me,
      so I rolled down the window and he gave me 3 envelopes he said I
      should deliver to the TAZARA train statin master, as a favor. I
      was puzzled and wondered how they could trust a random dude, but
      then I realized that failing to deliver the letters would have
      been silly. I had no intention not to deliver them. Actually, I
      kinda got a kick out of having a mission. But I was wondering
      "what if somebody just says yeah, yeah, and then tosses them out
      the window?" In such a case I guess the TAZARA dude would not
      trust tourists anymore. But maybe such thing never happened,
      which would explain why he would trust me. Maybe all the
      tourists are behaving relatively well, and that is why I am
      having a relatively easy time getting around....
    </P>
    <P>
      It's a 2 hour drive from Lusaka to Kapiri, and it went pretty
      smooth. Once we got there, we checked the train station out. It
      was pretty shady, but not the station itself as much as the
      people in it. Eventually I said bye to Aneesh, his mum and Mani,
      and proceeded toward the train which was already 1 hour late at
      this point. A somebody waved at me, indicating to go to a box
      office titled "immigration". Now, what the hell is immigration
      doing here, that we are about 800km away from the border? Well,
      I haven't figured out the answer to that one yet. At any rate,
      he told me to show him my passport, so I did. And he soon found
      out that I was illegal.
    </P>
    <P>
      That is right. Illegal I was. The dude at the Zimbabwe-Zambian
      border stamped me with a "VID" which apparently standed for
      "V1D", which ment "Visa one day", and this was on the 10th of
      June. Now, today was the 15th, so I was obviously illegal. Of
      course they knew what had happened and took advantage of the
      situation. I had to bribe them. I knew exactly what to do, I
      just didn't know how flexible they would have been. And as it
      turns out I could have bargained with them just the same way one
      bargains at the market. They asked for 400,000.  I should have
      said I only had 50,000. They would have said it was no good,
      then I would have said, OK, I can give you my emergency money
      too, but then I am only left with $50, so here is 100,000. But
      it didn't go that way.
    </P>
    <P>
      The main problem was that I had 200,000 in my innerjacket pocket
      and 50,000 in the front pocket of my trousers. So had I said I
      only have 100,000, and then stick the hand in my pocket and
      start counting only 50,000 would have been tricky, and I didn't
      feel confident enough to do this. At any rate, 250,000 later,
      they stamped me again, backdated to the 11th of June, with a
      "V7D". And, since it is always the last stamp that counts, I was
      now legal again.
    </P>
    <P>
      It is funny how thin the line between being legal and being
      illegal is. I often think about it.
    </P>
    <P>
      But at the end I, now legal, walked towards the main hall of the station, 
      where the mass of people was standing and waiting. Then the gates opened and 
      the crowd started to push forward. I was watching all from a little area, which 
      was kind of like a porch, a few steps elevated from the main hall. I later 
      found out that this was the 1st class waiting area. From there I assisted some 
      cop guy severely beat another guy for what I dont know, because I missed. But 
      this violent action caused the crowd to rush even faster thgrough the now free gates.
    </P>
    <P>
      A guy standing next to me, Clement, told me that those were the 3rd class peple 
      and reassured me that there would be no violence in the train (I asked him, as 
      a matter of fact).
    </P>
    <P>
      Once boarded I found my seat to be in the second couch and I was sitting with 
      two businessmen from Congo, and a TAZARA dude, who was not on duty. He was 
      very very nice and friendly and smart. He knew a lot, while the Congonians, they 
      were more on the silent side, but very nice and respectful. I slept in the 
      upstairs bed.
