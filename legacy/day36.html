    <P>
      But we left damnearly. Although he said 6am, he woke up at 5.30
      and by 5.45am he was in theruck already and had already sent
      somebody to come get me. . When I got in the truck, I realized,
      I had forgotten my hat inthe room, so the driver letme go get
      it. It was very nice of him.
    </P>
    <P>
      And the drive started. This time it was a lot better. I was
      sitting tinthe middle so it was very hard to slee, becuase I had
      nowehere to lean on. The senry was again really nice. We stopped
      at a few villagewss, then I think we only got one stop for a
      flat, but I am not sure anymore.Then the driver stopped at a
      village in the middle of nowhere for breakfast, but itwas a 10
      minute stop By the time I got donw, went to piss (they didn't
      want me to piss in the open desert, rather they wanted me to go
      to the latrine. also this I didn't understand) and got to the
      dark cafe sor t of shack,, an started to o drink my chai, the
      drive3r took off, and started to tell everyone it was time to
      go.
    </P>
    <P>
      So off we go. and we reach Moyale at about 1:30pm. I get
      tdroppedof some 1km away from the border. When I walk to he
      brder, I had to wait about 1hour for the immigration officer. He
      arrived, stamped me, then I proceedd. Also here a funny
      anecdote: I waited 1 hour, but when I got stamped, and was
      preparing to leave the immigration office (Kenya side) the
      receptionist was urgin me to hurry and leave. I wanted to tell
      him, that since I waited 1 hour for them, it would not harm them
      to wiat less than 5 minutes for me. But instead I just told him
      that I was preapring and was on my way.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then I had to sign a log book, and I crossed the border on
      foot. Once I found the second immigration (by this time it was
      round 4pm the office was still cloased for lunch. I waited only
      aobut 30 minutes for him to show up,then he stamped me, and I
      ent to the costums, where a ldy made me fill out yet another
      form, where I had to declare all the money I had and left me
      with a form that I have to give back at sotums when I leafve,
      writing down every time I exchanged money. Pretty bizarre.
    </P>
    <P>
      Once in Moyale, these dudes (Anthony and Brooke) picked me up,
      and took me to the Tourist Hotel, t that mike was talking about
      being the expensive one ($2.5/nite) but it was full. So they
      then took me to the second one, that Mike was telling me
      about. I was feeling a little sick, and wanted to rest. The guys
      were really annoying me, though, and they woke me up at around
      7pm, trying to get me to buy the ticket for the bus one day in
      advance. According to them, I could buy it up until
      midnight.Hard tory to blive. They were laso trying to make me
      change money, Ksh to ethipian birr for 11Ksh to 1birr. I did not
      do that though..An I think that t was a good idea.
    </P>
    <P>
      Eventually, they took me to get some food at the toursit
      hotel,and then we went over Sami's house, who was recovering
      from some form of flu (but they claimed it was malaria. maybe it
      was, but I didn't knwyou could recover form malaria in 4
      dyas). He had some godd grass we smoked and we talked a
      little. He is one of those artists that do the commercial ads on
      the walls. I was excited to get to meet one of these guys. I
      told him I would top by later twith my sketch book, so he could
      draw something for me. Then after sam, we went to a bar, ahd a
      beer, thencame back. The two guys asked me for some money, an
      they said that they would ask me tomorrow anymore. So I gave
      them Ksh150, after having noticed that you can buy one beer for
      35Ksh, while in Nairobi it was 80.. So I gave them a little bit
      more than 2 beers each, pus the beers I bough them at the bar.
    </P>
    <P>
      Just beforegoing to sleep, another guy,right after the two guys
      left, came at my door. I lwet hime in,and he gave me the
      storythat the rasta guys were thieves and that they robbed him a
      few days ago and that he was going to Nairobi to his mumwho was
      sick, butt now cannot go aymore becuase he finished his
      money. He is there fore staying at the hotel for free, but
      sleeping outside, blah, blah. I know he want money too.
    </P>
    <P>
      I don't want to give him money unless he exchanges some
      substantial service. He actually wants me to take him to Addis,
      but I don't want to do that, and I willl not take him with me to
      Addis.
    </P>
    <P>
      The nte ended with me waking up a little later, trying to go to
      have a piss, and the guy, Johnlamb, twas tyring to tel me that
      in order to piss, i canjust piss in the basin that' inthe room,
      bnut if I have to do number 2 ten I shall go to the
      latrine. bBut this was npt to easy to understand. He was using
      wordss for pissing and pooping that I waws not familiar with. or
      at least parts of them.
    </P>
    <P>
      After my piss, I got invited to haveg out with hime and other
      people working there, so I did. and I was getting all the
      problems of Johnlamb agian.I told him I was not interested in
      his problems, I told him tthat everyone I met wanted me to give
      themmoney after they told me about their problems. And that I
      cannot give money to everyone and that I have problems too, and
      they moght not be as bad as his, but we all have problems.
    </P>
    <P>
      After hanging out for a whilek , I went to bed removing the
      mosquito net, which was justmaking things worse, as it hwas 300
      hole in it, so it traps mosquitos in. Instead, I sleptwith the
      mosquito net for the head that my sister gave me and the blanket
      or actually without the blanket , but with just the sheet.
    </P>
    <P>
      I am planning in leaving for Addis on Sunday and excahningn Ksh
      to birr with the guys from the hotel which have promised me
      8.2birr for one USD and 10Ksh for one birr. The trip to Addis
      should be about 80-90 birr.
