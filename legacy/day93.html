    <h1>Day 93 - Tel Aviv, Israel</h1>
<h2>Saturday August 25<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

<P>• Good sandwich @ Aroma. Great ice coffee like a crush.

<P>• Siesta all day. Installation of 2.4.9 kernel on guy's laptop.

<P>• Meet Ruthi & Guy's dad thru pics & memorial movie.

<P>• Lease for Gay's new apt. The owner looks like Bruce Willis.

<P>• Then we got back to Guy's mum's apartment in Holon, and there was
the letter that Corina had sent me. She sent me a picture too, her
from behind with another 2 friends looking over the sea. You can't see
her face, only her hips, covered by a long red skirt, her favorite
one, and a tightish green shirt, which would show her back and
shoulders. I couldn't look at it for more than 5-10 seconds at a
time. What a wonderful body.

<P>And her letter was wonderful too. She really made me want to see
her again. It was a good thing, becuase the letter kept my mind away
from Hagar, Guy's siter, since I was sleeping in her bed, in her
bedroom, with her teddies all around me, and pictures, and
clothes... Well, I must say, from the time I talked to her over the
phone, that year that Guy's father died, and then I saw the movies,
and I saw her move, I fell in love. That's true. Those lips, and
voice, and movement... Golly. But she has a boy friend, and has had
one for like 5 years now.

<P>And Guy's mum? Out partying again, I guess. She didn't come home
tonite. Guy says she is looking for a partner.
