    <h1>Day 68 - Gondar, Ethiopia</h1>
    <h2>Tuesday July 31<sup>st</sup>, 2001</h2>

    <P>Yalew Ayker Hotel</p>

    <P>Wake up news: Dan counts his money and says finally "You know
    what? Also if I wanted to go to Sudan I couldn't because I don't
    have enough money". And with this quick sentence he untangled
    himself from all his problems. It seemed like this is what he was
    waiting for. He really didn't want to go to Sudan, although he
    was, when I first met him, extremely excited by the idea, actually
    so excited that it had seemed to me that he had come all the way
    here basically only for that. The traditional stick fighting in
    Sudan.</p>

    <P>So, when you travel with Dan, one thing is for sure: you never
    know when you will be alone, and when you will not. The situation
    was shaky all over, but it really changed all of a sudden when he
    decided to go to Omo. Then I really thought he was going to come
    to Sudan with me. But then he was gone, I was getting my VISA
    alone and was about to head for Sudan alone. And then, BAM! there
    he comes back from the Omo trip early, suprising the shit out of
    me, just to go to Sudan. Then we leave and he starts to regret
    having left the Omo trip. Finally, after 2-3 days of frustration,
    he bought a ticket back to Addis, just this morning. I know that I
    can still not be sure of what is going to happen until I leave
    without him tomorrow morning. Although this time, it's pretty sure
    that he wont come with me anymore, one still can never know. And
    also if he did come, it would mean he would be so unstable, it
    would be just like not having him there, in a way: How can you
    count on a friend that may disappear from your life any minute? 
    You can just take it as an "OK, let's just travel along together
    and see what happens, you keep ignoring me as much as possible,
    that way I can do the samne of you and not get too attached".</p>

    <P>I mean, it's sad that he is not going to come with me. He was a
    pain in the ass when he had problems (just because of his bad
    mood) but I was travelling with him for a long time (like a good 2
    weeks), and I was getting to know him pretty well, or, rather,
    better.</p>

    <P>Tele Satellite Club: most popular cafè in Gondar, always full,
    good stuff and cheap. Just under telecommunications office.</p>

    <P>Hint: in Cairo go to university (university or students club
    house).
