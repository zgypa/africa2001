      There are lots of females here! Definitely more than males. And great breasts too!
    </P>
    <P>

    <P>
      Do not buy coffee at the Dublin Airport. Never. It's horrible.
    <P>

      London, UK

      Well, not a good start for a day, but now I am feeling better. Nothing better 
      than a nice cup of Nescafe' coffee at a Nescafe' coffee house. And I must say 
      that there is actually a Nescafe' cafe' right in front of the Victoria train 
      station, with Internet station, like at least 50 computers. A must if you are 
      in Victoria. I also had a tuna melt sandwich, and it was also pretty good. The 
      bread tasted a lot like Italian focaccia. But well made! Bravo. This made my day.
    <P>
      Now I am off to Woodgreen, where I will meet Molly and find a tent, thermometer 
      and a towel.
    <P>
      13:30
    <P>
      Got the tent, water filter, water proof backpack protector and hi tech super 
      small, towel in the only camping store of Woodgreen. The guy was funny and had 
      this weird attitude of how life sucks (my first 3 choices of tents where out of 
      stock). I stayed there for about 1 hour and changed my mind from initially not 
      wanting to buy the tent (looking around other stores first) to realizing I was 
      low in time and should have visited Molly. That was 182 quids.
      <H3>
        Molly
      </H3>
    <P>
      I spent the afternoon with her, starting by mowing the lawn, she told me about 
      all the neighbour things (she seemed to be doing very well) and introduced me 
      to Maria from Genova Voltri. She seems very cool, but did not want to give me 
      her address in Genova. She's 27 and went to the Ruffini institute in Via XX 
      Settembre. Mah. I think Molly will be able to get her address. At any rate, we 
      then proceeded to polish my shoes. She can polish shoes better than me, which 
      aggravates me quite a bit. But then again, it's the experience. She claims to 
      have learned in the army, when she was volunteering... In the whole, I had a 
      great time with her, and I am happy to have seen her, and am happy that she is 
      doing all right, although she is, in fact, taking lots of pills. But her memory 
      is strikingly sharp..
    <P>
      I then proceeded to Gatwick again, where I met the rest of the crowd i.e. the 
      people that were going to Lusaka, friends of Aneesh (which allowed me not to 
      have to stand in line for ever).
