    <h1>Day 84 - Eilat, Israel</h1>
<h2>Saturday August 16<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

<P>• Wake up in Cairo at around 6am, and I took a cab to the Tourgoman
bus station to catch the 7.30 bus. The cab charged me 7.50Elbs.

<P>• At bus station the bus was filled so I bought tickets for the
9.30 bus. I had to wait there for a few hours. That was most
difficult. With the busses honking and getting really close to the
chair I was sitting at, and with the stink of trash all over I was
about to lose it. I was happy I was going to leave and see guy soon.

<P>• Met Rob on the bus. He was also going to Taba, but with a bike
(he put it on the bus and they charged him double, another 50Elbs for
it.

<P>• He showed me some pictures (slides) he did, while we were o the
bus. Some good stuff. He told me about his 14mm corrected lens
(corrected, so it does not distort.) interesting. I want to check some
of those out. He showed me some tricks of how to use flash with long
exposition, thus freezing humans, or moving objects, yet getting in
the light of scenery and dead objects in. A great idea.

<P>• The drive through the desert was very interesting. We stopped at
Nakhl, a small town, like an oasis, were it is really hot, but
dry. You don't really feel the heat too much, and the walls of the
houses (white)) are not too hot neither. But the place was deserted,
still a reminance of the Israelis.

<P>• I met this guy there, who was asking me if I wanted to smoke some
Bango (which is grass) but i DIDN'T have time really, and I didn't
want him to give me any, becasue I didnn't trust him, and also because
I was going to cross the Israeli border in a few hours.

<P>• More desert sceneries were amazing. From sand dunes to dirt
desrt, and eventually to deserted mountains, or hills. We emerged out
of the hills, and I could see the blueness of the Red Sea stick out
from the bright brown of the deserted hills... It was all just
amazing.

<P>• Crossing the border was a procedure in itself, even more for Rob,
who had to constatnly take his bike apart, and put it back
together. He has a trailer to. First the security check at the
Egyptian side, then the passport stamp at the egyptian side. Then you
enter the Immigration building on the Israaeli side, which looks like
an airport. Just amazing. The Egyptian side, it seems like they got a
little intimidated by it, so they built their side similar. It also
looks like an airport, but not as much as the Israeli side. Then you
do the Israeli security check, were a guy litterally checked and
touched every corner of my body, apart the crotch. He did that part
with a mettal detector. Then the israeli passport stamnp, then the
Isralei customs (they didn't even check there, they just stamped my
paper). Also, at the security check, they give you a small paper, with
4 stages: Security, Passport, Customs, and Car/Vehicle check. At
aevery stage you get stanmped. Then, when you exit the
gate-airport-border office/building, the guardian asks you for that
piece of paper, and if you don't have it, hw wont let you out.

<P>• There is a bus every half hour that connects the Taba border with
Eilat and costs 5.70NIS. The exchange rate is anyware between
3.80-4.15NIS depending if you change at a hotel or bank.

<P>• I told Rob that I would meet him at the information center in
Eilat. So he biked, and I waited for the bus. I saw him from the bus
as he was pedalling with all the weight of his trailer and smiled... I
wanted to shout to him, but I couldn't as the windows were closed
inside the coach.

<P>• The information center was closed, but not just closed for the
day, but closed for good. There were a few telephone numbers at the
door, but the lady at the desk said she would only take care of the
Jazz Festival, that is going to happen here at the end of the month
(27-29August). Martin Medeski and Wood are playing here, as well as
Take 6 and ron carter, billy cobham in an interesting band.


<P>• Rob came, and we went for the Red See Hotel and found out that
their prices were very high :30NIS for the roof and no bathroom or
shower, 80NIS for dorm room, and 100NIS each for a 6 bedroom room that
we could have used in 4. So Rob decided to discuss in front of a beer,
so we had 2 pints each. The beer sunk into me and I got quikly
drunk. We eventually decided, after talking to a couple, which gave us
some good advies, then liquidated us, i.e. got rid of us, by saying
they had very important things to talk about, to go up to downtown and
look there.

<P>• So we did and fount the Taba Hostel, for 35NIS/nite, and checked
in there. Locked up everything, then headed for the bus statino, were
I called Guy, Rob called Yuval ( af riend in Tel Aviv), went to
another pub, got a huge salad, then met Guy at the Texas Grill, then
moved to another bar on the sea were we had some more drinks and
hummus...

<P>• Then we went back to the hostelI picked up my stuff, said by to
Rob, who was going to leave fro Tel Aviv the next morning and headed
over to our hotel, which was a lot better.
