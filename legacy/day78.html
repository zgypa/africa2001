    <h1>Day 78 - Khartoum, Sudan</h1>
    <h2>Friday August 10<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

<P>• The day today was a complete rest. I am not feeling to well, so I
stayed at the sailing club with a headache trying to get some rest.

<P>• The Swiss guys said that the VISA extension they are trying to
get would take a few days, util saturday, which measn we cannot go to
Meroe together neither today, nor tomorrow. I think I will have to go
alone following my initial plan.

<P>• At around 3pm the air started to get thicker, as the wind kept
blowing. The atmospere was very reddish, the wind was probably blowing
up some dus from the desert around. AT some pioont the air was so
brown, that even the Nile looked blue. And that was when my
tempetation of jumping in was the greatest.

<P>• Cultural exchange with the Swiss (Philippe and Marcel from
Losanne): I gave them the Calvino book, they gave me Andrea DeCarlo,
Di noi tre. Marcele almost finished my book. He is liking it. I am
happy he is. I liked it too. Maybe we can talk about it once he is
done.
