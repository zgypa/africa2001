      <h1>Day 62 - Addis Ababa, Ethiopia</h1>
      <h2>Wednesday July 25<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

         <p>Wake up, meet neighbours, peace corp neighbours, from
         Kenya. Have breakfast next door. Good mini-pizza's and good
         donuts.

	 <P>Stopped by Immigration for the visa
	 extension. 105birr. Gotta pick it up tomorrow. Crazy building
	 the immigration office.

	 <P>I am in the need of getting out of Addis. I need to
	 procede my journey. If I can't get a visa for Sudan, fuck it,
	 I'll have to skip Sudan and fliy over it. So I look around
	 for flights, but there are many that are too damn
	 expensive. What I found from Yemenia was great, but not
	 available. They put me on the waiting list for this weekends
	 flight. I don't know what to do, I don't think this will come
	 through, but if it does it would be fuckin' awesome Check
	 this out: fly to Egypt through Sahan'a (Yemen). But the
	 Sahna'a flight arrives 3 days before the next flight out to
	 Egpyt. (This is what I found out I could do by going directly
	 to their offices. They did not tell me this at the agency, so
	 I was missing a lot of opportunities for getting out of
	 there.) So I get to spend 3 days in Sahna'a free (no need for
	 visa, whish are hard to get for there, for same islamic
	 reasons that they are hard to get for Sudan.) just with the
	 flight ticket as visa. Let's hope for the best. I like this
	 deal a lot. They only need to call me tomorrow at the hotel
	 telling me something opened. Yeah right, "ONLY".

	 <P>So great. I come home at the Wutma Hotel to find out that
	 the phone lines are still kaputt. Perfect. So this makes it a
	 certainty that I will not recieve my phone call
	 tomorrow. Also the Baro Hotel has problems with them. Which
	 means no convenient internet for me. So I go try out some
	 alternatives. Internet at CPU computer center. Many ports
	 firewalled out and I am not able to do ssh. Discordia is not
	 responding and it's .75birr/minute. So no email, only logbook.

	 <P>So I tell my self: "Fuck all this Shit!" and I went to
	 Pizzeria Don Vito. A very expensive (comparitavely) Italian
	 pizzeria. And I must say it was indeed a good Italian
	 pizzeria, and a pretty high class one too! Definetely more
	 Italian pizzas there then in America. The situation is wierd,
	 though. An Italian restaurant being served by Ethiopain
	 ladies.

	 <P>With my new Peace Corp friends we went in search for a
	 nonexisting disco where students hang. Another failure. We
	 ended up at the Memo Club. A place of hores. Off of Bole
	 road, right after the big comunist star over the
	 road. Extremley expensive too: 15birr to get in, 10 birr for
	 bear, 8birr for water or warm soda. Cold soda
	 yellem. Fuckin'... And the toilets: toilet paper: only by
	 demanding the Housekeeper will she give you a piece or two of
	 "soft" (toiletpaper).

	 <P>Bah.  So I decide to check out the back, right next to
	 the toiles by the housekeeper, a young girl with a name that
	 I forget already. There I meet all sorts of girls, one of
	 which (Tsahi?) takes my brown hat and goes for a ride. Then
	 another comes, so I ask why the hell don't they simply put the
	 toilet paper in the toilets, since the place is so damn
	 expensive? But the girls gave me a very straight answer, one
	 that I was not looking for, but that I guess I had to take
	 since it qulified for an answer-allright. It was "But you
	 see, if somebody needs more paper, they can just ask for more
	 at the beginning, and if somebody doesn't use it all, they
	 can always take it back!". It felt kind of hopeless to try to
	 explain that that was exactly what I was trying to avoid in
	 the first place. Basically I asked them why do they try to
	 save toilet paper, and they answered that it wasn't that bad
	 to save toilet paper. Does it actually mean "saving is part
	 of our culture, and also if we are rich, we still try to
	 save", or does it mean "we need to employ people, and this
	 way we get a job for a housekeeper"?

	 <P>When I went back inside, a girl finally approaches me: she
	 seems nice and turns out to be japo-ethiopian. She wanted to
	 come back home with me, in bed, that is. Why didn't I take
	 her home? But then again: There does not have to be a why. I
	 mean, I always do something for a reason: I stop and ponder,
	 then I always have a reson for what I am doing. But in this
	 case, she was very close to me. It was done already. All I
	 had to do is to take her hand and leave. And I really wanted
	 to. She was intersting, and I kinda liked that japanese in
	 her. But instead I was strong and decided not to. But what
	 really made me not want to do it is the speculation that I
	 might not enjoy it in a night like this one. And this
	 actually could be true. I mean, I would only have 4 hours
	 until it's 7.30 in the morning. But, OK, say I would wake up
	 at 10 to go do stuff. Yes that's true, I could have done it:
	 spend 6 hours with her, maybe start talking naked and smoking
	 up a little,... But then again, I want to do it when I have
	 nothing to do the next morning. So here I go. I at least
	 could have had a good fuck after such a day, but I blew that
	 one off too.

<P>Guess what? I forgot my knife there, my camping knife.
