      Day 41 - Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
    </H1>
    <H2>
      Wednesday July 4<SUP>th</SUP>, 2001
    </H2>
    <P>
      I decided to keep up with writing in English, since the
      audience/readers will be more this way.
    </P>
    <P>
      I woke up from the hotel and went straight to the bus. I jumped
      in, put my luggage up on the rack (as a matter of fact it was
      some guy of the bus who put it up for me. yesterday, some random
      guy did it for me, and asked me for 25 birr. Only later I
      realized I was supposed to give him only a few birr (2-5).  But
      since today the bus staff did it, they charged me nothing.) and
      sat down, this time on the left, that is on the east side. My
      reasoning was to get the sun in the morning when it is rather
      chilly, and not have it during the afternoon. I was also trying
      to sit where I wouldn't be disturbed by people closing the
      window...
    </P>
    <P>
      Somebody sat next to me, and I was puzzled, since the bus was
      not full yet. In the western world, I am used to seeing all the
      window seats go first, then it slowly fills up. But in this
      case, he sat next to me, and at first I thought he was doing so,
      because he didn't want to sit next to a random dude. As a matter
      of fact, this is a different technique: if you get the window
      seat, you never know who is going to sit next to you. But if you
      pick your neighbor yourself...
    </P>
    <P>
      The bus left and he started talking to me. He had just graduated
      from the Dilla University College in Biology. And I believed him,
      because his English was good, and he even knew what "protrude"
      meant. And we talked a lot. He told me about the mud houses, and
      how they are mad with grass, some special grass that is very
      thin. He also told me how the buses work: One company hires
      buses with drivers to drive along the stretches that they
      decide. I think it's one company per stretch. The buses can
      either be individually owned, or they could be owned by another
      company, who, in turn, hires drivers and staff. Then, to make
      sure that the buses are not over-filled, the head company sends
      agents to check all the tickets during the trip.
    </P>
    <P>
      And our bus was a very old and beat bus. Consequently it was
      also very slow.  The graduate, whose name turned out to be
      Afework, told me that the driver had agreed not to stop at the
      bus station in Awasa. I think he agreed to this because his bus
      was so slow, that if he would have stopped at all the bus
      stations, we would have never arrived to Addis.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then Afework also explained to me how the bus stations work:
      every bus that goes there, has to pay a fee before they
      leave. This explains the guards, and the gate at the exit. So
      now the buses want to stay as long as possible at the station,
      in order to get as many passengers as possible, since they are
      being charged to go there. He explained this to me once we got to
      the Shashemene bus stop.
    </P>
    <P>
      I soon realized the real reason why Afework was sitting next to
      me: on the other side of the corridor were three colleagues of
      his, so he probably wanted to sit next to them. One of them was
      a history major, and he read the Ethiopian history section in
      the lonely planet guide. He smiled and said that there was no
      time to comment on it, meaning there was a lot to say, but the
      wrong setting.
    </P>
    <P>
      And Afework told me about his school, and how they get
      professors only with PhD and some are from England, Holland,
      Japan and many from India, because they are cheap. And then
      sometimes there are some field trips, where some western schools
      send their students, maybe 15-20, with professor to study the
      forests of Ethiopia. So also the students of the local school go
      with them, with their professor, and in 2 weeks, the professors
      teach in turns. Afework said he likes the way the British or
      guest professors teach, since they first give out handouts, then
      they talk about it, and they answer questions. The locals,
      instead, are more like the Italian professors, as they don't
      want to answer question and have that typical "It was hard for
      me, it should be hard for you too" attitude.
    </P>
    <P>
      He also told me that the grading system is similar to the
      American one, and that you need a 3.8 from high school to get
      into college. Then the computer selects which college you will
      go to. He graduated from College with a 3.3.  being on the Dean's
      list.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then I told him about Nader and the 5% and the elections problem
      in the States.  And he told me some Ethiopian history, and how
      he kind of liked the fact that the Italians were here as they
      have built most infrastructures. He also said that most
      Ethiopians are proud of the fact that they were colonized for 5
      years only. (Funny enough to this respect the history section in
      the lonely planet guide has a contradiction: it says that
      "Ethiopia is also unique among African countries for having
      never been colonized in the great European 'scramble for Africa'
      of the 19th and 20th century". But then, a few paragraphs later,
      it states "In 1936 the country was overrun by Mussolini's
      Italian troops, who remained until 1941 when they surrendered
      to Allied forced during WWII". OK, fine, they were not
      "colonized" for 5 years, but they were "conquered". Now what
      difference does that make, lonely planet?
    </P>
    <P>
      After stopping for lunch around 2PM in a place that, according
      to Afework was half way to Addis, but was obviously not, since
      we arrived Addis at 5PM and left Dilla at 6.30am, we got to
      Addis. I had arranged with Afework that we would take a cab
      together, and then stop by his house to meet his mother, who had
      come back from Italy to see him graduate. His mother, in fact,
      divorced from her promiscuous and I-don't-care-about-my-children
      husband 12 years ago, then she went to Israel and worked there
      for 5 years, and then got a connection to go to Italy, Rome,
      actually, and work there as an accountant. And she has done so
      for the past 5 years.
    </P>

    <P>
      So we took a cab, and went straight to Wanza Hotel, which was
      the place that Mike had suggested me to go to. But it was
      full. We finally ended up at the Baro Hotel, listed in the guide
      as "a traveler's favorite". After dropping our stuff off there,
      we took the locals (taxi-bus) to his house, where I met his
      brothers, but not his sisters and his mother, as they were not
      in. They all live in one room, with TV and kitchen. They know
      they are living cheap, but since they have no need for higher
      quality life, they can deal with cheap living.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then we came back to the Baro, and tried to call Federica, but
      the cell phone would not work, or the line would not
      connect. So, eventually I went to bed, still carrying my cough
      and runny nose. Afework said he would come in the morning so we
      could go to the Sudan Embassy and US Embassy and take care of
      Business.
