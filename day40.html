      Durante il viaggio mi sono venute in mente precchie cose da scrivere: Come la 
      gente usa il clacson in Tanzania
    </P>
    <P>
      During my trip today I was thinking about various thoughts I wanted to write. 
      One of them being the way the Tanzanians honk and how the trucks all have those 
      crazy horns to better honk. A panel with 6 or 7 colored buttons is attached 
      vertically next to the drivers door. As he presses one, or the other, different 
      tunes come out. He can also press more at the sametime, creatig vary iteresting 
      sounds, but they are very loud.
    </P>
    <P>
      Another thing is how there is a lot of red groud here: in europe dirt is more 
      brown, like i ameraca too. here it seems to be more red. there is grey too, but 
      a lot of red dirt.
    </P>
    <P>
      Thn there is the roblem with Ethiopian politics. I think Geert might e right 
      when he says that it is moving towards dictatorship: the stop that our bus had 
      to do during the trip to Dila, where really many, and they were not just like 
      the zambian, or Tanzanian checks, where they sort of look at the paper workand 
      let you go. Here, at each stop, we all had to get out of the bus, the army went 
      inside, quickly inspected all the luggage, thenclimbed on the roof, and went 
      thhrough the luggage there. Then we could finally go back iside, but that was 
      not all: then they would come inside again, and check the ID cards of everyone.
    </P>
    <P>
      Many ladies were smugling KIWI shoe polish today. They had the cans in long 
      clear plastib bags, and rolled the bags aroound their breas and waste. I was 
      very curious to see what was going to happend, when, at one of our last stops, 
      the military guys started to pat everyone. To my huge surprise, they did not 
      pat down the ladies at all: oe fo them was obviously hiding somethig, as she 
      had a huge squared, beerbelly. They also did no t care about me, also when 
      doing the ID card control. Theey never asked me for it. They were laughing at 
      me, though.
    </P>
    <P>
      Other then that, I felt a little frustrated. The trip is starting to get on my 
      nerves. Now that I have done some planning I feel a lot better about it, but 
      today in the bus I was not too happy, for some reason. I was bitching to my 
      self at the people behind me who would constatnly and with no worries push my 
      head aside so they could get to he window and pull it shut. I notice people 
      here don't care too much about respect for others. But it was not really that, 
      i think, that was annoying me. It was more the fact that they were shuting the 
      windows when in the bus I was sweatig hard with a T-shirt, so there must have 
      been something like around 30Â°C. But that also was something I knew was going 
      to happen, as Mike warned me about it.
    </P>
    <P>
      Tonight I have sort of planned the next days, and if all goes well, I should be 
      in Israel right around the 24th of July, which will give me a good week to 
      spend with guy.
