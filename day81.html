    <h1>Day 81 - Cairo, Egypt</h1>
<h2>Monday August 13<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

<P>• Then at 1am or so, I decide to become part of the mayham of
securty and work my way in the interior of the airport, where they
have aircon. At the cafetereia (upstaris, no aircon) I meet Ruggero,
from Napels, who is into Construction and was working on building the
Hilton of Port Sudan. He started talking and didn't stop. He told me
about his wife, who had ictus, and became paralized just 2 years ago,
and this trip was like a breake from the tedious life he was leading
trying to make her feel as if she still had a life. He always said he
would go to Egypt with her, but now that she's paralyzed, he realizes
it will not happen, so he simply decided, out of respect, not to go to
Egpypt at all. His daughter is in biomed tech sales of some sort. He
also told me how he spend the first 40 years of his life in Italy,
then moved to Nigeria with family and all. Then came back, dropped off
one daughter in some private school in Rome with a brother in law, but
then he moved to Sicily, with the daughter. So then he moved to Sicly
to for a while.... Oh, he just went on talking. Now he was heading
back home after the headaches of trying to get stuff done in Africa,
which we all know a little about. Me just because I lived in Italy for
a while. He also told me about his cure for his tyoroid problem. He
got an injection of alcohol and something else I forgot directly into
the gland, and it shrunk like 90% (which is very good, apparently). He
also thinks that people here are more dumb than in Europe making the
example that all the technology and stuff installed here, they don't
know how to work it, also after weeks and weeks of training. He
divirged the topic of conversation, maybe realizing that this was not
a good ground to make such a statement, by saying that the colonialism
ended too abruptly. And there he might have a point. Maybe if the
brits, and french, and italians and so on would have stayed longer it
would have helped the africans get used to things a little. On the
other hand it would have created other problems, like in South Africa
with Apartheid and such... who knows?

<P>• On the plane we lost contact, and I made contact with another
man, who was offering me to help me out in cairo, which was a great
relief. But then, after he picked up his luggage, he said he would
wait for me outside, but still had to change money (which he
apparently forgot about). After I changed it, of course was not there
anymore. I actually found him in the bus going downtown (which I had
to find myself). Sometimes people who seem helpful they might be, but
they are so unthinking (aren't they everywhere, though?) that they
become unhelpful again. Like this guy. Also if he forgot I was
changing money, and was really waiting outside, and didn't see me
come: where did he think I was disappearing? Like that I flew back to
Khartoum, or something?

<P>• The time machine over here was incredible. It felt strange. I can
really feel the effects of it. I mean how much of a time machine an
airplane actually is. Now that I have felt what it is like to do miles
the hard way, being in Khartoum with no ticket or way to Cairo on
sunday morning, and checking in at the Sun hotel in Cairo at 10am of
Monday morning really makes you ponder. it should have taken me at
least 6 days to do the trip....

<P>• The hotel is nice. I am staying in a drom room with 4 other guys,
one australiand, a guy from danmark, who looks very good. Definetely
very cute. I can see many girls liking his features. His name is
Casper.  

<P>• He showed me around a little, since he is leaving tomorrow and
has seen a little more of Egypt than what I have seen. He took me to
this marvellous Internet Café, the best one I have seen in my
life. It's a high class café with, in a corner, 5 computers or so,
with a fast connection (maybe cable modem? I didn't ask, but I was
downloading from brillig at 12KB/s), and, of course, shisha, which you
can smoke at the computer, which I have of course done. The rpices are
not too high, compared to western prices. Maybe they are high for
here, but it's worth it. That place is really "Cool".

<P>• Talked to Guy, he called me at the hotel, after getting my
email. I informed myself looking at Casper's Egypt lonely planet
guide, and it seems it only takes 7 hours to Teba, which is at the
border with Israel, then I can take a taxi or something to Elat, but I
think Guy can pick me up there. It all depends how soon he can be
there. 'Cuz I could probably be there Thursday.

<P>• I lucked out, since Casper seems to be a nice guy. He is going
tomorrow to Giza, and to the Museum, which is exactly what I wanted to
do. So we will wake up at 7am, and see if we can get there.
