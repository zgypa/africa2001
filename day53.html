   Day 53 - Lalibela, Ethiopia
  </H1>
  <H2>
   Monday July 16<SUP>th</SUP>, 2001
  </H2>
  <P>
   To go to the Ehiopian Airlines office, one has to go up a few steps, until onne reaches
   a small house with a relatively decent view of Lalibela. Up there we moved our tickets
   from departing the 21st from Aksum to the 23rd. No problem, the man said. We could pay
   once we got in Aksum, se we decided to do so.
  </P>
  <P>
   And off we were for the churches. We were very excited becuase this time around we knew
   we were going to be free, with no guides. And it was great.
  </P>
  <P>
   First we stopped at the Bet St. Georg where I stopped and did a drawing, removing my
   T-shirt, as Dan did, but getting a sunburn. Kids kept on coming, and I also talked to a
   truck driver, a not too talkative one, who was there with a kid and somebody else.
  </P>
  <P>
   We then proceeded to the other churches of the Western Cluster, on the search for a
   good place to smoke a little. We found a small place just next to a small graveyard.
   With the help of some very nice kid, with some leg problem, we think we figured out
   that the people buried in that graveyard all fell victim of a conflict. But we didn't
   really know how this anecdote really connected with history.
  </P>
  <P>
   There are so many good pictures one could take of these rock hewn-churches, that it is
   not even funny! Eventually we walked down these stairs, and when you looked back up to
   them, you could see them illuminated by the sun... steps going under a small tunnel...
   Gorgeous. I hope dan sends me the shots...
  </P>
  <P>
   After that we still had some prety amazing moments, like talking to the priest and the
   kids and showing them the pen that lights up, and trying to bargain them down for
   something that dan was buying, and running in the dark tunnel. But soon thereafter the
   day in this graet Amumsment park was over, and we had to go back to the town.
  </P>
  <P>
   So we decided to have a beer, and then have dinner at the Seven Olives. We ordered,
   then we heard some noise from the streat, and asked what the hell it was. The waiter
   said that it was a wedding. So we went down there to check out the scene, and some kid
   brought us downt some alley, to somebodies back yard. There were tents protecting most
   of it from the rain, and a table with him and her in it, and music playing and people
   dancing. Dan got pulled into the center and he started to do the typical Ethiopian
   shoulder dance. He was very good in my opinion, and was able to keep up with this local
   guy who was pretty good himself. I was very impressed and was thinking that it would be
   pretty hard for me to do the same, as I didn't feel as comfortable with the environment
   yet. But wait! The song is over, another one starts, and somebody pulls me in the midle
   now, this time I get offered one of the beutiful wedding girls..I don't know what to do
   as she starts and stopps, so I do something for a while, maybe a few minutes, maybe a
   tune or so, then I stop. But it was OK, no problem. And we decided to go back to the
   restaurant and see how our food was doing.
  </P>
  <P>
   So we ate and came back out in the search of the wedding and found anothe one at that
   blue lal restaruant: people doing noise and singing, then they started walking down the
   main road dragging us in. A guy with viedo camera like Dan's, but with IR vision
   impressed him very much. He couldnt' belive there was someone with something more
   technological than what he had.
  </P>
  <P>
   And there was a girl, very open and crazy, who happened to be a Harar chat dealer...
   Dan was excited, as he figured he ahd a hook up in Harar, a very good one, the best
   one, actually: what better hook up couldyou get in Harar, the chat city, than a
   openmindned female crazy chat dealer?
