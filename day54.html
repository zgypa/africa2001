      <h1>Day 54 - Laliblea, Ehiopia</h1>
      <h2>Tuesday July 17<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

      <p>Today was the extra chill day. The day that was not supposed
      to exist. I mean we added, we decided to stay an extra day,
      since the day of yesterday was so good. So we decided to go to
      the Monastery, the Asheten Mariam Monastery at the top of a
      hill, like at 3700m. A 2 hour hike. Very pleasant. Dan was very
      fast in walking up. I had to slow down. We had two kids as
      guides, one of them was the boy with the red shirt, which is the
      guide that Dan wanted to begin with.</p>

      <p>And with them we ascended the mountain. On the way up we ran
      into some farmers, highland farmers, and Dan started to beat the
      barley with them. It was great. He was also really good at it! I
      wish I had a picture of it. Then all the kids, as you ascend,
      the farmer kids start to follow you. They can go up and down 10
      times a day before they get tired. No problem. They are used to
      doing it with 50kg bags of barley on their back.</p>


      <p>Up there, the monastery was great: There was a knife of land
      behind the monastery that extended a little into the void of the
      valley. On the shoulder of the blade of the knife, just on the
      edge, there lay a shithole, a man made concrete shithole. I took
      advantage of the location of the shithole, and took a crap
      there, at 3700m looking down at Lalibela and its valley over a
      30m drop. And Dan took advantage of my shitting and took
      pictures of the whole event. Pictures with details...</p>

      <p>Another amazing scene up there was the cloud scene: They were
      amazing. As the storm was moving in and out (the rain season)
      you could see these clouds going up and down the mountains, now
      making it very foggy, now clearing it up. You could just stand
      on that blade and be amazed.</p>

      <p> Here is what I wrote as Dan was taking a picture of me in
      the rain, on the top by the monastery, typing on the visor:
      "ZMonapstery of . 3700m. A rock sticking out with 220 degrees of
      view over aawwnafenwifia a mthe w iner,,mceani i am lookig at
      the hemisphere of the world. aI amout hthere.  damn!!!!! hrlp i
      am flying......and i am writing all this odwn . all i am
      sayiojgi am writing down."</p>
      
      <!-- START CENSOR --> 

      <p>And indeed that was a crazy experience, as we had smoked up
      quite a bit, so it really felt like I was flying in the valley!
      Wow. It was really great. I could have stayed there for days. I
      can understand how the priests live. With lots of grass!</p>

      <!-- END CENSOR -->

      <p> And the descent was a lot easier then going up. Dan, decided
      to buy one of the sheppard's hats for his dad so he did from a
      guy that was walking down with us. But he bought one that was
      too small (he only realized this later, you know, when you buy
      something, it takes you a while to find out whether you really
      like it or not). So he found this out only once he ran into a
      bigger one on the way down. The diagnosis of the situation was
      simple: Dan had made a mistake. According to his life filosofy,
      there was no problem with this, as long as he fixed it. So he
      tried to see if he could get his money back from that one guy.
      Then buy the hat from the other hat-seller-girl. But the guy,
      obviously, didn't want to exchange again. So Dan offered him the
      hat back (cost 25birr) in exchange of only 15 birr. The boy
      would then be left with the hat and 10birr, sounds like a deal
      for him, right? But the boy preferred 25birr today, than 35birr
      tomorrow, and didn't want to do the trade.</p>

      <p>Eventually Dan succeeded by giving the girl the hat he had
      bought and 10birr in exchange of the bigger hat. Now, that was
      not too easy neither. It was hard to convince the girl that that
      was actually a deal for her. But she finally agreed. And then,
      at the same time, also the boy agreed, that is he uderstood that
      he would be making a deal out of the exchange he had, upto a few
      minutes ago, not wanted to do. But Dan was firm and told him
      that he realized to late, and lost his opportunity.</p>

      <p>
	So Dan got his hat, and everyone was happy. I must say that
	our little boy-guides did a great job in translating. Without
	them the whole deal would have been impossible.</p>

      <p>
	Lots of beggers, but when we got down, we took our buddies to
	the Asheton where we paid them. It turnes out we met Werner
	there. He was a guy I had met in Addis, when he had just came
	back up from his 9 day Omo Valley safari trip.</p>

      <p>
	And Dan started having lots of fun with this kid as he found
	out that Werner was a profesional Skuba diver. He was doing
	cave mapping in different underwater caves in the red sea and
	Australia. Gosh what some interesing adventurous stories:120m
	deep dives, kicking the silt, masks smashing onto your face,
	thining problems... Wow. Dan was really entertained. Or
	rather, let's just say that Werner gained many
	credibility/reliability points for Dan.</p>

      <p>
	Now we wanted to have some food. So we went to look in the
	main square, but couldn't find anything. Finally we found a
	place, but they were going to take too long to prepare the
	food, so we just decided to go to our hotel and to eat there
	instead. And that's what we ended up doing. I took a shower
	that night too. A shower with warm water heated up in big tin
	cans over fire...</p>
