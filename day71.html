    <h1>Day 71 - Gedaref, Sudan</h1>
    <h2>Friday August 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2001</h2>

    <P>I found the real Karkade. They serve them at any corner of the
    streets. And they have other stuff too..</p>

    <P>And I went to change some money from the customs, and the
    Ethiopian kid was with me, and he saw where I put my money, which
    was in the jacket, and I forgot that they saw that, so I left my
    jacket inside a truck, but that wasn't a safe enough place. He
    opened the pocket, took out the check book, took my pen, and
    closed up again. He left my Visor. The Ethiopian bastard stole
    $200 inTC & ca $60 in cash with 2000 dinar. OH, well, there are
    greater losses in life, aren't they?</p>

    <P>Finally we leave. I feel pretty bad. I know this trip can be
    hell. But it isn't raining, so I know that if it stays this way,
    I'll be good. All I need is a truck that does not brake and a
    <I>dangerous driver</i>, as they like to call them here. Dangerous
    used in a positive way: see, if somebody kicks ass at something,
    he's dangerous at that. And that's pretty true. </p>

    <P>Well, OK, I'm in the bus writing know, writing with the stylus,
    and, well, the transmission shaft is scraping the ground. I guess
    it's OK, right? I mean what would you do if your transimission
    shaft of your car were to scrape the ground? Keep driving, right? 
    Right. So that's what we do. After all we better keep driving
    until we just completely brake down, or we'll never get to were we
    can fix it.</p>

    <P>Oh, look! The hub is leaking oil, and the transmission lever is
    broken, the starter's dead, the radiator is leaking and the brakes
    have problems, such that we must go slow.</p>

    <P>What a beautiful scenary, though: A flock of white birds (you
    find them where you see cattle or water) crossing the street, a
    road on land, east Sudanese land.</p>

    <P>Gassim (the tranportation guy, who gave me a ride on "his"
    trucks) invited me to his house, where I slept, and hoped it was a
    flat. I wonder how I could possibly think that. Maybe it just was
    in my conception that since he was sort of making some money, he
    would have a flat or something. But there is noone in flats. I
    mean for some reason, I haven't met anyone that lives in flats
    yet. I wonder... But instead it was a very clean mud-hut with
    toilet and shower outside without roaches or insects. Slept outide
    on one of those wooden bed frames that I have seen in Lalibela in
    the churhes for the fist time. It was good! Very good! Too bad
    there were mosquitos, but the sky was clear, I could see the
    starts, and I was in the hood, basically. Interesting staying
    there.</p>
