      Wake up, as one of the first. Me and Mani decided to go for a
      coffee at the reception area restaurant and Kamal eventually
      joined us for what was a great experience. The restaurant had
      something like three terraces, at three different levels. The
      view was about 60km into the savanna onto a small pond.  One
      could just sit there with binoculars and observe. Sureley one
      would be able to see animals. So one ponders: Why drive around
      like crazy on safaris when the same "one" can stay in a
      restaurant, eating drinking and chilling and seeing the same
      animals? One cannot answer the question as it was not just one
      who went for a trip, but a number of people, namely 14. So it is
      not upto the one to make the decisiions. And this was a true
      fact.
    </P>
    <P>
      At any rate, the restaurant, and view were fabulous. The whole
      lodge, as I said is a dream. But after the breakfast, Mani
      stopped by the gift shop and purchased a box containing 4 hand
      made paper cards (that is the paper was hand made as well) just
      like the paper Olga makes. I thougt they were very pretty and
      bought one myself. Then I also bought a notebook made out of the
      same paper. I thought I wanted to draw. yes, draw. I am writing
      a lot, but I am not drawing, and while it is true that I have a
      camera (my indistructable Canon Snappy 20) it is also true that
      I do not have all the equipment to take the pictures I would
      like to take. So drawing would be great. Then this idea evolved
      to a better one, one which would let me have a goal: Why not
      prepare this drawing notebook as a gift for my good friend and
      artist Jeff Vincent? So that is what I decided to do. As soon as
      the book is full, as soon as I run out of paper, I ship it to
      Jeff. I know he will like it a lot .Then, when I get back to
      Cleveland, I will scan it, and put the whole lot on my webpage,
      along with these notes.

    <P>
      I separated from the group to have a bite to eat. I found this
      white local who walked me to a little store space. It had a lady
      in it, and a bar.. It was a kitchen, basically. He said I could
      eat local food there. But it was too late, and the lady said
      that she had finished all the food already. I was say, as that
      looked pretty good to me. So I proceeded, and found myself
      between a bunch of sculptres on wooden or concrete
      pedistals. they were on a grass in display by 3 different
      galleries. all of them really nice. With crazy prices, or at
      least, crazy for there. But then again, you were paying for the
      best of the local art. There was some Soma and some
      contemporary. More contemporary, though. Soma I found more on
      the streets. Then I had a sandwhich at this shag that said
      something like "get-together". The lady who served me was
      fabulous. She sold me aslo some tomato flavored chips, and a
      Coke. While sitting there enjoying my drinking and drawing a
      little fo this scene, i was approached by several men, the first
      one who claimed to be a boy scout (he was in uniform) and was
      asking me either for money or work. Since I was not alone, and
      could not give him work, I gave him some money. Very little, but
      it was the change I had in my pocket, and he seemed to
      appreciate it. I signed a little piece of paper, which looked a
      little shady, but not too much, and all was good. He was
      nice,though. He was telling mehow they sometimes engage i
      different projects like buying some chicken and then selling the
      eggs, or like what they were doing now, which was collecting
      some money for a camp where they would train young boy scouts to
      do stuff.

      We all met again to go downtown and do some shopping, and some
      getting-used-to-africa activities, which included but did not
      seclude, being able to deal with 5-6 people talking to you at
      the same time, showing you art that is very similar from which
      you have to choose from while at the same time not loosing your
      temper. Not easy. But the curios (curious objects in the form of
      curious shapes) they had were many. I turn a conrner and all I
      see is stone statues on the ground. A huge field of
      them. Hundreds, thousends of them. And behind them, a moltitude
      of artists, brothers of artists, sisters of artists, friends
      of... you get the picture. And as soon as you step in front of
      their space they start. And this is the funny part! Only if you
      get close to them they start. Then, as soon as you leave, the
      leave you in peace. Then if you come back that way, no matter
      how much you bought or didn't buy, they start all over
      again. It's crazy, but among that moltitude of artists, there
      are some that have really cool stuff. The question is, how am I
      going to get this stuff to another continent? Stone is heavy. So
      I didnt' buy any, thinking that I would be in the continent for
      a while, so I might as well take it easy with shopping.

      It was now time to go to the balloon, which was a tourist
      attraction to get a better view of the falls. The balloon was
      attached to a strong cable to a motor onthe ground and was
      filled with helium mixed with air. It was pretty interesting to
      see thetechnology and how they have done ti, but it was not too
      great. You get to stand in a narrow octagonal corridorfor about
      20 minutes as it goes up and down.

    <P>
      After the balloon we went to a restaurant at the kingdom, which
      is a really big hotel with casino and a whole bunch of
      activities which have as their primary goal that to make you
      want to exchange money for them. Very touristy, and very
      western. The food was amerinca style diner food. But after that,
      some members of the group stayed at the kingdom and went to its
      disco. I did not go, as I was really tired. I went back home
      with Mani and Vijhung, which was getting very impatient getting
      onthenerves of many members of the Vengans (this name was given
      first to the bus, then to the whole group. I believe its origins
      stem from some kind of cinematographic prodution, but I am not
      certain of that). At one point, he decided he had enough and
      told everyone he was going to leave and left. At which point, I
      stood up, called him, he stopped, I showed him the keys to his
      lodge and he stopped and came back. The evening ended with us
      goig to bed, with my attempt to draw some constellations being
      defeated by overcast, and with the rest of the gang coming back
      from the disco drunk, tired, yet with the intention of staying
      up all night, as we had to wake up at 5.30am the next day.
