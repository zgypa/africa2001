      Day 47 - Addis Ababa, Ethiopia

    <P>
      So today is tuesday. And I wake up, call the embassy, they tell me to all 
      alter, so I go change some money. I dress up heavily, and off I go. i change 
      all the travelers cheques I have left, which is $60. Then I come back and run 
      into the Berkeley dudes. They say that they were going to check out the bus 
      station to buy tickets for tomorrow to go to Harar, and I asked if I could 
      join, since I wanted to know where it was so I could then go to buy tickets, 
      maybe in a few days, for Gondar.
    </P>
    <P>
      Before we leave, I try to call the Sudan embassy again, but they tell me that 
      the VISA dude is not in, so to cal tomorrow.
    </P>
    <P>
      So we go, and the dude with the beard, David, after some walking around the 
      Merkato area, gets stressed out, and says that he can't take it anymore (since 
      we could not find the bus station) and took off towards the hotel. He was also 
      starting to feel sick. So me and the other dude proceeded to discover we made a 
      wrong left turn. Eventually we found the bus stop, and discovered that my trip 
      to Gondar would be 2 days (on night stopover only) and 77birr. While his trip 
      to Harar would be some 13h and around 53birr. This was a surprise for him, 
      since he thought it would be around the 30birr. So he didn't buy the tickets 
      and we proceeded to look for a taxi in bus-mode to go home. And indeed we did, 
      and were also able to say no to a taxi in taxi-mode and went off to find a 
      minibus that took us straight to piazza, and we then walked home paying 6-7 
      times less. He thanked me for the interesting experience, although he had 
      already taken those kind of public transportation. I also made him save a bir 
      or so, as he was asking for the price inside the minibus. I told him not to do 
      that, but just to look at what the others paid. I also told him never to pay 
      more than 1.40birr, since that was the price of the longest trip one coudl 
      possibley take around town.
    </P>
    <P>
      When we came back, I decided to call it a day, and wanted to rest. I didn't 
      want to stretch it and risk a fever.
    </P>
    <P>
      But after dinner, on my way to my room, I run into another Daniel, this time 
      from New York. We talk up until past midinte. He tells me about the Kite 
      constellation that I found, which, in fact, is called the Southern cross. He 
      tells me about the Solar Eclipse, and all his travels and writing adventures. I 
      tell him about my ex job in Neurosurgery. We agree to meet tomorrow to go run 
      some errands together.
