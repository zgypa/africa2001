<i>The first part is still the rest of <a
href="day34.html">Mike's travel tips</a>. The second part is a
reminder of some common places in Addis: Kera is an area after Mexico
square. Afework never wrote Mexico, nor did he ever see it written
anywhere and that's why it's misspelled/corrected (after all you don't
really happen to hit the word "Mexico" in college, do you?). Also
"Piassa", which means square, from Italian, and should be
"piazza". Interesting. After all Amharic is a phonetic language, so it
doesn't really matter, does it.

      Afework was relatively sharp. He arrived at about 8.30, took a
      shower in my room, since he does not have hot water, and off we
      went to exchange money and to the Sudanese Embassy. It was a
      trip to get to the Embassy since neither of us knew where it
      was. But Afework estimated it would take 20 minutes to get
      there, but in fact it took us about one hour. It was a hard walk
      for me also if it was all downhill, and we took the wrong left
      turn twice. But we eventually managed to get there, and as we
      were walking toward what seemed to be be a reception office, a
      gray haired man approached us and asked us what we needed.  I
      said a tourist VISA. "What nationality?" "US." "You need a
      letter of recommendation from your embassy". And as he said that
      he was about to leave. I was not satisfied with this answer, and
      started to do what he most disliked: I bombarded him with more
      questions like a machine:

        How many pictures?

        2.

        $60.

        More than 72 hours

      <LI>
        How many copies of the letter of recommendation do you need?

      <LI>
        Only one!

      <LI>
        What should be stated in the letter of recommendation?
      </LI>
      <LI>
        The embassy knows what to write.
      </LI>
      <LI>
        OK, thank you.
      </LI>
    </UL>
    <P>
      He was very annoyed, but to my surprise, he answered all the
      question.
    </P>
    <P>
      On the way out Afework was pointing out that I was being a little
      rude, but I didn't really care. After all, if they don't give me
      a VISA, it will mean I will have to skip Sudan, which in a way
      is good, as it will make my trip a little easier and shorter.
    </P>
    <P>
      At this point I was really hungry, so Afework took me to the
      Sunrise Restaurant, which is owned, apparently by an
      Ethio-Italian lady, whom I have not met. The place looks like an
      Italian villa, with a little garden with tables and a gazebo
      outside, but not dustbins. We sat down and had some marvelous
      fruit salad (which was listed under "juices" in the menu, which
      made me think they were making/preparing a juice of mixed
      fruits) and avocado/papaya juice. Very good food. I strongly
      suggest if anyone happens to be in Addis.

      Our next goal was the American Embassy. To do so we needed to
      use local transportation. Now, you need to know first how local
      transport here works.  There are 4 main types of
      transportation. The city bus, which is the cheapest, looks a lot
      like the Italian city buses, but is not advisable. Not only
      could it be dangerous, but there is no map or routes of where
      they go. There is only a Gregorian calendar that locals have,
      which has on the back a list of where the bus numbers go and
      start from, but not in a graphical form. And in Amharic
      too. Then there are the white and blue taxis which work pretty
      much like buses, but they are either minivans or cars, and they
      start from place A and go to B, and they shout out where they
      are going. One has to know therefore where to go, and where the
      taxis that go there leave from. You can also hire one of these
      blue and white taxis privately as a regular taxi, but the trip
      can cost you up to 40 birr if you cross the whole city, while if
      you take them in Bus Mode it will not cost you more that 1.4
      birr, but you will have to wait until it is full. Then there are
      the yellow taxis that primarily serve the
      airport-Hilton-Sheraton lines and charge Western prices.

      We wanted to make sure that the embassy was actually open, so we
      stopped by the telecommunications building to call them and find
      out. That was quite interesting, as inside they were not able to
      find the phone number in the phone book (latest edition of
      88/89). Then they told us to dial 97 for information.  And
      Afework managed to go through the line and call, but there was
      no answer.  Maybe out for lunch? Then back inside, he was 
       inquiring in Amharic, which saved lots of time. Eventually, we
      looked ad the phone book again (in Amharic) and found the number
      to be 550-666. We called. They were open so we went.
    </P>
    <P>
      So we took the minibus taxi in bus-mode to the Piassa, then had
      to find where the other minibusses to Shromeda left. Once we
      found them, we could head toward the US Embassy.
    </P>
    <P>
      At the embassy Afework stayed out. I went in, and had to take
      everything off for security. The security lady laughed when she
      saw the visor keyboard. Then I went in. There was a big hall
      filled with Ethiopian. Maybe 50-60 sitting on chairs facing a
      TV. 10 teller windows, and the last one said "US Citizen's
      services". There I was told that the embassy does not give
      letters of recommendation, but they gave me a letter that
      explained this. A pretty interesting gone, as it talks about how
      the US government does not forbid any carrier of US passport to
      travel in countries around the world, so there is no need to
      issue such a letter. There is also a small section where the
      embassy encourages the other nations to not request such letters
      any more for US citizens.... Pretty interesting.
    </P>
    <P>
      So that didn't take too long. Afework was waiting for me
      outside, and then we took the taxi/bus back to the Piassa and
      walked to Baro Hotel. When we got back, we said hi to a Dutch
      lady, and told her we would go quickly to the post office. ,The
      ideas was to ship the Bao game so it would not weigh, so I could
      travel lighter. The post office near by said we needed to go to
      the main one.
    </P>
    <P>
      The main post office (mind you, we had to get there first, and I
      was feeling sick) told us, after selling us a box for 6.65birr,
      that what I was trying to ship was some artifact that needed
      permission from the museum to leave the country. So stupid us,
      we actually went to the museum, on the other side of town,
      Arat-kilo (4 kilos). there, the lady that was supposed to do the
      paperwork was not in and they told me to come back tomorrow. But
      Afework ran into a friend of his, and another lady said that
      in fact the lady in charge was out for tee and I could have asked
      her if I waited a while. So we waited for about 30 minutes, and
      when she came , she looked at the item, and after me telling the
      story, she said she could not help me because the item was not
      Ethiopian. Now, I knew about something like this, but I had
      forgotten about it. Any ways, at this point there is nothing to
      do but to carry it to the next nation.
    </P>
    <P>
      Afework was very disappointed with the bureaucracy, but we headed
      home. Afework suggested a shortcut. Which took forever,
      according to me since I was not feeling too well. On the way
      back we stopped to buy some bread and water, then headed
      straight home.
    </P>
    <P>
      The evening was short after that. I got fever that night. I was
      up for too long moving and my health was not doing better. I
      took some aspirin and went to bed.
