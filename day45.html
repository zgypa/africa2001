      Another day spent in bed, but mainly reading. At the cafeteria, today, I met 
      two people, two french, that lived in Berkeley, so americans, but french. They 
      are here to teach English and they will start teaching around the 20th of July, 
      so they are planning to do something before that. One has a funny beard and hat 
      and looks like some religious character. The other looks like a berkeley 
      vegeterian fag. But that's just how he looks. He is very nicem, and is in fact 
      vegeterian, whih is not a good thing for somebody that will be in Ethioipia for 
      a year or so.

    <P>
      But the highlight of today was that Afework came to visit. He came with his 
      brand new suit which he paid 400birr to have done, and 500birr for the raw 
      materials. He saved for years for that dress that he will now wear at his 
      graduation. He stopped by to see how I was doing before he went to visit some relatives.
    </P>
    <P>
      Back to bed. I hope that tomorrow I will feel better and be able to move.
