      Day 43 - Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
    </H1>

      Friday July 6<SUP>th</SUP>, 2001

    <P>
      Another crazy day. This time, when I woke up, at around 9, I
      didn't know if Afework was going to show up or not. But I did
      know one thing: I was not going to do much today. Only go to the
      Sudanese Embassy and drop off the VISA application. And then
      come back to bed and rest.
    </P>
    <P>
      Afework showed up around 10.this was very good. So I told him
      the situation, and off we went. We took the taxi/bus that was
      yelling Kera-Mexico on Churchill Rd. to go to the embassy. We
      got to the embassy, dropped off the application.  The funny
      thing was that we ran into the same guy we ran into yesterday,
      in the same exact spot, as we was walking out of the room in
      the same way he was yesterday. He asked me if I had the
      letter. I said yes, then he asked Afework if he had any business
      to take care of. To which he answered that he was with me. The
      guy said then (in Amharic) "Then your place is outside!" that
      just to indicate what kind of a person he was. In the office I
      filled out the application, dropped off two pictures, and he
      said to come back on Tuesday. No fee. On Tuesday I would be told
      if I would be granted the VISA or not. Only then I could
      actually start the application process.
    </P>
    <P>
      After the embassy business was taken care of, we went again to
      the Sunrise restaurant, and had breakfast. He had a burger which
      (I tasted it) was horrible, but I guess he liked it. Then I
      brought up the idea that I had to go do email, and he told me
      that morning that he had to go to the tailor to have him make a
      dress for him. That he would have done at the Merkato, the
      biggest market in Africa (apparently). What we eventually decided
      to do is that we would take the taxi/bus to the Hilton, I would
      jump off there, while he would continue to the Merkato, and then
      he would meet me back there in a few hours, so to give me time
      to do my email.
    </P>
    <P>
      And we did that. The Hilton was a relaxing experience. I was
      walking very slow, just like I had been doing for the past
      couple of days. I was still sick. I sat at a computer. They had
      a modem per machine, I believe. I downloaded my ssh, and did my
      email. 2 hours of email 300birr, which is about $36. A good 18
      buck per hour. After that I was looking for my good friend, but
      couldn't find him, so I walked around and exchanged more money,
      and that was a very good idea. Then I tried to call the LVIA
      people, got a lady who told me that the Italians were out for
      lunch, to call them on the cell phone. I was not going to call
      the cell phone from the Hilton, as they were charging 10birr for
      that.
    </P>
    <P>
      Afework finally arrived, and we walked around the hotel a
      little, since he had not seen it. Then we came straight back to
      the hotel. And I called the cell phone from the hotel and talked
      to the Italians lady,, whose name I do not know. I asked her for
      a doctor, and she told me the Hayat Hospital is where they always
      go. I wanted to rest, but they said they were running errands so
      I could meet them in 30 minutes at the Olympia building. So me
      and Afework hopped on a taxi and in taxi-mode we got there in 15
      minutes. Waited there for a few minutes, and sure enough the
      Italians showed up. They were a little surprised to see Afework,
      but we took him with us to the hospital.
    </P>
    <P>
      At the hospital, They took my blood pressure, heart rate,
      temperature, and 4ml of blood they tested for parasites, and
      counted WBC. then I had a urine test and a chest X-ray. At the
      end, it turned out I was exactly right. I thought that with the
      cold I got on the truck, I had gotten some bacterial infection
      in the lungs, which I called bronchitis. I thought I had to take
      antibiotics, but I was happy that I came to the hospital just to
      make sure I didn't have some tropical disease like Malaria. It
      turns out that bronchitis is more of a viral thing in the
      breathing passages, and that I had Pneumonia, which is a
      bacterial infection in my left lung. The doctor backed this up
      by saying that The blood samples were clean from all parasites,
      but there was a very high WBC count, 15000, instead of
      4000-10000 (when he said this, I thought "dow, that's why I have
      fever!"). Then he pointed out that 18% of them were neutrophils,
      which indicates a bacteriological infection somewhere. From the
      urine sample he excluded kidney/bladder infection, and from the
      lung x-ray he could see a white spot, rather large in the left
      lung, which looked like some infection of some sort.
    </P>
    <P>
      Then he gave me the option of whether to stay in the hospital for
      2 days, so he could inject antibiotics IV, or to stay home and
      do it home. I decided the second option. I agreed that I would
      come back in a week to take another chest x-ray and pick up all
      my files/records, and I left with Afework to the LVIA
      headquarters. There Gabriele and the lady entertained us for
      very little time while wrapping things up, then we happen on the
      pickup truck in 4 in the front cabin and drove back toward town
      to look for a pharmacy. We found one, and I bought the
      medicines, then we came home. I said bye to them ans thanked
      them a lot, since they took me to the best hospital in town. And
      indeed I must say, it was a petty good hospital. They took so
      little blood from me, I didn't eve notice anything.
    </P>
    <P>
      Afework stayed with me a little longer, until it was too late
      for him to catch a taxi in bus-mode home, so I gave him some
      money, 20birr for taxi-mode. I took my antibiotics and went to
      bed soon after he left.
    </P>
    <P>
      I shortly thereafter woke up feeling very feverish. I put the
      thermometer on my head and I couldn't see anything. But I looked
      at it as I pulled it off, and I saw the colors go down from 40
      down to 35. So I probably was VERY hot. So I popped 2
      Paracetamol pills, as the doctor prescribed me to take in case I
      get fever. I took a long while, but eventually it went down
      again. And I was able to fall asleep again.
    </P>
    <P>
      Woha what a day. Now I have to stay in bed for at least 3 days,
      as the doctor said. But he said to stay until all symptoms are
      gone. That is no cough or runny nose. I don't necessarily have
      to stay in bed until i finished the whole antibiotics cycle, but
      until all symptoms go away. That is the important part. I Hope
      it wont be too long. I hope to be better soon.
