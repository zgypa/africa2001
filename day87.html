    <h1>Day 87 - Jerusalem, Israel</h1>
<h2>Sunday August 19<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

<P>• Todfay was fix it day. What we did was basicallly get the car
open and be able to drive off. It entailed going to the airport to
pick up the package with the keys that Ruthi sent over air freight,
then calling the insurance towing truck, who arrived around 3pm, and
having him tow the car to the electrician of Eilat. The tow truck
driver was very nice. Also the electrician. They did a good work, and
bypassed the immobilizer with no major problem, then actually soldered
the starter wires, where the bypass was. That, for me, is a good
job. Then we went back to Corinna, who was still on the beach and
picked her up, then picked up our stuff from the Hotel, and at about
4-5 we took off for Jerusalem, on the dangerous road. The dangerous
road passes through some palestinian land, just before Jerusalem, but
it's some 100 km shorter. We decided it tobe safe to drive through
there, although there was a miscaclculation: We thought it was day,
but by the time we got there it got to be nite. Oh well, but all went
well.

<P>• Guy's apartment here is like a little studio, one room, but very
nice. we cooked some sauce with this technique that Corinna has to
cook peppers, which is great. They turn out to be basically
roasted. She puts them in olive oil, and lets them on low fire for
like 30-40 minutes.

<P>• A little of Campari, a little of internet, and then I went to
bed. Corinna was complaining for the noise and the light in a very
winy fashion. I was kind of annoyed by it, but on the other hand I
could understand that she wanted to sleep.
