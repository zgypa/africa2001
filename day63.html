      <h1>Day 63 - Addis Ababa, Ethiopia</h1>
      <h2>Thursday July 26<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>

      <P>otcho (coccio): hard crust injera, brown.

      <P>Annababoro: double injera. Had it in debre damo.

      <P>I stopped at L.A. Burger on my way back from Memo Club, where
      I went to pick up the pocket knife that I forgot, which btw, I
      could not retrieve, as the <i>guy with the key</i> was not in,
      and I met this guy Girma Bizuayehu (09)227345. He offered to
      meet tomorrow @ 11am and drive down to Nazret with Yohannes,
      owner of pub and friend of Girma. And so I am thinking about it
      and I learn more Amharic as it keeps on pouring outside. I get
      home soaked.

      <P>charrask: i am finished; chaarasku: you are finished?

      <P>By the time I get to the Yemenia ticket office, it was like 5
      or 6pm. I had to pick my visa extension too. I get in there, and
      they tell me that they tried to call me and were asking were the
      hell I was, that there was an opening at 1-2pm, and they needed
      my confirmation. I didn't even try to tell them that it would
      have been pretty stupid of me to stay at the hotel waiting for
      their phone call all day, and that I had other errands to run,
      and that it was pretty obvious that I wanted to be on that
      flight, since I was on the waiting list. So I was totally
      disappointed. I asked them to see if they could do something,
      and as they were typing hopelessly on those keyboard of their, I
      remember Douglas Adams and his hitchhikers tips. So I asked them
      for a phone and I made a last minute phone call to the Sudan
      Embassy, since I hadn't called them in a few days. And the guy
      said that yes, we can get the visa's. That we should bring the
      passports in tomorrow or Monday.

      <P>Wow, now that was some news. Sure I didn't even know how such
      a news would even sound. Well, now I do. And I head straight
      home with some happy news in my pocket.

      <P>I run into nairobi-peace-corp-buddies as I walk into my room,
      and I feel happy for the visa, but at the same time I feel sad,
      because Dan is not with me and he was supposed to come to Sudan
      with me. But the buddies, nairobi-peace-corp-buddies, tell me
      that "my friend is back". So I'm like "Wathefk? He left
      the-day-before-yesterday. Isn't due back for at least 10
      days!". I go check with the hotel people and they tell me he is
      at Baro doing email. I run over there, in the rain, and see him,
      big-ol' Dan in that small room chatting with the owners of the
      Baro. What a nice vision. He had come back. He had thought about
      it again, and now wants to come back to go to Sudan with me.

      <P>Seeing Dan and hearing his 2 day story was just great. I
      loved it. And especially I loved his mosquito spray sound. Dan
      is great at sounds.

      <P>"Astera Aworka" good funk

      <P>He me up with his buddies and found out about this "Teddy
      Afro" gig tonite. Apparetly it's Teodros's band. Good jazz. They
      play live @ Coffee House in Sidistkilo. They played
      standards. The drummer lacks initative but is a good
      pocket. Very tight. Guitar absolutely amazing.

      <P>"Nazret Pension" Close to train station: attractive crazy
      girls. Younger than 20. All locals only 5birr. 

      <P>akul: half,  sidist akuu =6.30
