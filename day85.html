    <h1>Day 85 - Eilat, Israel</h1>
<h2>Friday August 17, 2001</h2>


<P>• Woke up around 10am and went to the beach. A relatively calm
beach day. Nice water, beautiful bodies, and lots of bikini's. Angry
people. We went for a swim and when we came back there was a boy
sitting on one of our longchairs. We told him (Guy did in Hebrew) that
we were there first, but he didn't give a fuck. Another guy had to
propose just to get anotherchari, have the bastard guy move over a
little, so we could both fit. Butwhat the fuck? Why should they be so
arrogant? I mean, also if I had nothing on that chair, and you take
it, if I tell you it was mine, you just trust me and excuse yourself
and give it back. Jesus!

<P>• Guy's bag got stolen. I put my hipbag under longchair. They only
took his bag because it wae sitting on the chairs. A very stupid
move. I was lucky, but i should have left my shit in safe.

<P>• in bag he had 400NIS, 2credit cards, car keys,

<P>• At the police station Guy andCorinna were able to block all
credit cards and cell phones and the lot. They were able to get info
on how to get the spare keys from Jerusalem into Eilat on a flight
injust a few hours. Basically they fixed everything.

<P>• We had dinner at the Texas Grill, were we met the day
before. Weate a shit load of food, and went home exhausted. The couple
is doing a great job in not letting the stolen bag affect thier lives
too much. I would mimagine most of my friends, or just people in Italy
would have not reacted like that. I can't know though.
