<i>After a few days of being in bed I decided to draw again, but I
didn't know what to draw, so I drew the room I was in with me in
it. The man on the bed is me, sick. Next to me, my famous hip-bag.

      Day one of sickness. At the reception they gave me a book by
      McBain, Romance, translated in German. That gave me at least
      something to read. Or to do. Then, at the "Cafeteria" of the
      Hotel, I met Daniel and his 2 friends from America.  He,
      in fact, has just started his Ph.D. in Anthropology by studying
      Amharic.  They seemed nice, but didn't want to talk to much. The
      girl didn't even turn toward me.

      I eventually returned to bed and read, and played with my visor,
      I played computer games. Then I started playing "flip-it", and
      remembered how Guy and Eli got good at it. But I can't figure it
      out. I figured out that with the 4x4 board, there are 2852
      possibilities of different combinations, and only one is the
      correct one (if one chooses the board that can be solved in 5
      moves).  Anyways... Not much of interest to write about. I
      stayed in bed all day.
