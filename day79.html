    <h1>Day 79 - Khartoum, Sudan</h1>
<h2>Saturday August 11, 2001</h2>

<P>• supposed to buy tickets for train & ferry, but don't feel like
it.

<P>• Marcele gives me a ride to pharmacy for Malaria Test. Test center
is by train station,but open 8-2.

<P>• we come back and find philipp talking to some dude who tells me
about some private institution, one of them being chinese and really
close. It was closed as well. But they do chinese medicine there.

<P>• The swiss left for Gedaref. They had to be in Addis by the 3rd,
when Phillips girl arrives.

<P>• Maybe I should take a flight to Cairo. Priewise it wouldn't make
much difference and it would save me some time.

<P>• So I still don't know if I have Malaria or not, but I think it's
just a flu: sore throat, headache, some caugh (white expectorate) and
aching bones from fever. No diorrhea or intestinal problems. No fever
that comes and goes. Today no fever, but still head and throat
soreness and weakness. Lots of that.
