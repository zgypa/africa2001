    <h1>Day 88 - Jerusalem, Israel</h1>
<h2>Monday August 20,2001</h2>

<P>• I tried to call Jeff again, but with no success. I tried to call
him last nite, after I called my parents, and no success. Always
answering machine. What the fuck is he doing? Where the fuck is he? So
I called Johnny, and he told me he is supposed to be there. I tried
again after calling Johnny and Alex, who told me all is the same in
Cleveland, and proved it. From his stories it really does seem the
same, man. Incredible. I think I will try to call Ciccio now. Guy told
me that Mec got merried. I need to find out...

<P>• I caught Jeff as he returned from Buffalo and tom picked him
up. The talk was great. West side? What to do with Corina, he is in
touch with her. He was very active in summer. Tom Hays mailed him all
my emails.
