<h1>Day 55 - Woldia, Ethiopia</h1>
<h2>Wednesday July 18<sup>th</sup>, 2001</h2>


<p> Spendig a night in Woldia was not too bad. I was sort of
afraid. Let's just say that after we stopped here for a few hours on
owr way to Lalibela, I thought it would be a boring place. Instead we
found a pretty hotel that was not too expensive, and had a toilet, I
mean a real toilet, locked up. They gave us the key to the padlock, so
it was basically our priveate toilet, although it was supposed to be
communal.

<p>
Then Dan left and came back with a boy, which seemed to be cool, and
we wanted to give him somehting, so he tought him some martial arts. I
got some of the lesson on his video tape.

<p>
After the lesson we went down to eat something and to chill in the
town, and we had quite some fun. Eneded up in bar or two, or more of a
Tej Bet, which would be a Tej house (yes the Bet of Bethlehem means
house), and had local musicians play. They had something that
resembled a one-string rudimental violing without fretboard. In fact,
one had to apply [pressure on the string directly while paying
attention not to get out the harmonics. Kinda tricky. Dan danced with
some lady. Then we bought some Tej (as Dan wanted to get some to bring
home in NY with him) and went to bed with our friend, the friend dan
picked up, Lyou Werk. n fact he said he could not wake up on time to
help us get on the bus, so Dan just told him to sleep over. I didn't
think it was a great idea, but it was OK.

<p>
Or actually not really: too hot, and too many flees/bed bugs as
well. I know have hundreds of bights all over my body, but primarily
were I rest, that is on my sides and around the underwear line.
