<p>Today I basically chilled. I didn't know what to do, because yesterday I just        went to bed without planning. I woke up around 11am, wrote the last 3 days of        this book, and organized somethings, fixed my pouch, and finally at almost 1pm        I went for lunch and breakfast and started to see how I could get out of there        and move on. The plan was not too bad: go down town, buy a ticket on a shuttle        bus, ad leave. And since I was in town, I could have also done some internet and        exchange some money.</p>
<p>The guy I met yesterday and talked about physics, he was apparently part of        this safari group, and was waiting for his group to get back. I saw him today,        as he was preparing dinner for the group, that still had not arrived.</p>
<p>When the group came back, one guy started talking to me and saying how there        are two groups and some people are going to Dar the next day and some are not.        Then I started putting in the drawing book the rules for the bao game. As it        turns out, they guy I had just met, was called Bill and today was Bill's        birthday, and the game I was writing rules for, I ended up playing with Zachery (       <a href="http://www.mountkilimanjaro.com/"> http://www.mountkilimanjaro.com </a> )which made me live through quite an interesting experience.</p>
<h3>Zach</h3>
<p>Zachery, in fact, as you can see from his website, is 34 and has a few kids. He        first started to be a priest. But soon God made his future turn around, and he        quickly became a mount Kilimanjaro guide climber. Then one day he met these        americans, a couple, that were very interested in him and believed in him. So        they wanted to help him start his business. After climbing the mountain with        him, they went back to america, and the Americans assisted and sponsored his        business: they fist send some money for the office, then some for computers,        and Zach slowly built up a name in the internet too, being served by the        american friends.</p>
<p>One day the americans decided to go back to Tanzania to see how Zach had spent        the money. When they saw that the business was actually there, they were        surprised but happy.</p>
<p>We played bao together and as we were playing I started having serious doubts        about the rules, as I feared.</p>
<p>The night then proceeded with Zach being extremely drunk on coffee and double        whisky ( he had 7 of them) and paid some for some ladies, and half one for me,        and at the time of paying the bill, he was giving Adolfa very hard time. That        was funny and interesting the way Adolf was looking at him, knowing that he        had money, and was just extremely patient. Then one of the Englishmen came to        pay too, and this guy was ready for some serious bargaining. Being to drunk, he        was obviously unable to see that that was a place were you could not bargain, at the most he could get a discount, since the ir group was very big. So the        bartender gave him a discount, but the man insisted more and more and wanted to        drop the price. But Adolf could not bend, because he knew that any more        discount than what he gave already, it would have had to come out of his        pocket. Eventually the drunk Englishman paid and left.</p>
<p>After all this I went to bed.</p>
