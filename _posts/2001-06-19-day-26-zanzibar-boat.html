<p>Today I woke up in the bed, by the Norwegian, whom I told to       wake me up in the morning. I had breakfast with them, then I       started to play Bao with Adam, who was teaching me how to       play. I immediately wanted a board myself, so I decided to buy       one. myself. Then packed my stuff and checked out, with a damage       of like 44USD. The beach in this place was absolutely       marvelous. Ladies were always on it collecting see weed to       export to the Japanese, who like to eat it.</p>
<p>I was basically waiting for Adam to be ready, so we cold       go. This didn't happened until after lunch,though. And when he       said we were ready to go, I asked if we wanted to smoke some       ganja, so we went and did it on the beach. But it was a lot,       and he ended up not smoking any, basically. So i had to do it       all. or almost, and was smashed, then we walked to the dala-dala       stop, and that was very hard, maybe because when you are stoned       your heart is racing quite a bit, and maybe also because it was       very hot, and I had to carry the heavy backpack and such.</p>
<p>At any rate, at the bus stop we met this guy, who seemed to be       one of Adams buddies, and he started talking in Swahili, and I       was going crazy, as the language was tripping me out: it       sounded like Genuese, or Portuguese, but I couldn't understand a       word (not that I can understand a word of Genuese or Portuguese,       but the point was that it sounded very familiar, yet it was       very distant). I could relate with their expressions, and       Adam's buddy said that from the way I laugh he sometimes thinks       that I understand what they are saying, and I replied that when       I laugh it's because I think I understand too.</p>
<p>Then we hopped on the back of the pickup truck with seats and       roof, I mean on the dala-dala, and headed off for the city of       Zanzibar. The ride was silent. i was just really stoned and       looking outside at the vegetation that , as it was winter, it       was all green, like intensely dense and green. And I thought       to myself:"thank god it's Winter! In the summer how is it? Like       you have to leave because the vegetation just takes over?" But       then again I was stoned, so I don't know how much this thought was       important.</p>

<p>Once in the city, we get off at the port, to go buy the       ticket. I decided not to stay another night on the island, and       instead to save money and ride the ferry at night. That way I       get 2 pigeons with one stone: a place to stay, and the ferry       all for $25.</p>
<p>We headed for a beer. On the way, I got convinced by a street       bum to buy another elephant tail hair bracelet (which was used)       for 1000Tsh. Then we stopped for the beer in stone town, which       is just like our old city in Genova, maybe smaller, with the       streets better maintained, or less old. We stopped at a bar,       just in front of a bureau of change, that I mistakenly did not       use, and i bought Adam some 3 beers, gave him 1000Tsh, just       because I had "lots of them", and gave him 2000Tsh, so he could       buy a chicken alive, for his family. I was in fact going to buy       him some food at the bar, but then he thought about it, and told       me just to give him 2000Tsh, that way he can buy the chicken,       and I can still have some change for the night ferry.</p>
<p>Then he started to talk about what I should do and that I am now       on my own life, and should therefore watch it. He basically preached       and told me what an idiot I had been with the rastafarian (I had       told him the story while at the beach smoking), and how I just       wasted another 1000Tsh for the street guy. He talked ant talked,       and I was silent, had nothing to say. He also told me about his       salary, and how it is not enough, and never will be enough. I       was trying to tell him that also when it is enough, people here       can't save, because the rest of the family comes to collect it,       but this seemed to be a thought that he didn't too much pick up       , as he was mainly concerned about my safety. He wanted me to       call once I get to Arusha.</p>
<p>I was very touched by this conversation. He was talking to me       like a parent of family friend, giving me advices and telling me       stories that are just like the ones somebody who loves you would       give you.</p>
<p>Then we went for a walk. He decided he would walk with me back       to the port, as he thought I would get lost, or so something       stupid again. On the way we had some kebab sort of thing, for       100Tsh each, and it was great. Very good. Then he departed, and       went home. I turned around and headed back toward the port, at       the ticket counter, were I had left my luggage.</p>
<p>I sat on the curb, next to some street people, this time aware       of what they were and who they wanted (or the other way around       but it works both ways). The one guy next to me on the right was       clearly tripping on heroin. They obviously started a       conversation, and I was chill about it all. After a while, I       decided to have a smoke, and as soon as I pulled out the       tobacco, they swarmed.  Everyone wanted a smoke, so I started       rolling, and rolled like 4 or 5 cigarettes, and then called it       quits. and said no to the others. I recognized one guy who       seemed to be nice in the group, he was Arabic, ad he was       actually the one who suggested to stop rolling by saying out       loud"OK last one guys, last one for everyone!" and I agreed. We       all had the smoke, then I asked at the counter if it was time to       board, she said yes, and I went in to pick up my backpack, dropped       the 12V stabilized 3Amp transformer, and headed for boarding.</p>
<p>The boat trip was very nice: they put us in the VIP lounge,       basically all the tourists, with some kids that were friends of       who worked there. I met the tourists, who were two couples, one       from England, this guy who came down to work for 6 months, and       now is sort of traveling back to his research city, which I       think was Arusha, but I am not certain. The other couple, he was       South African, and she was Californian. He had climbed the       Kilimanjaro last year and paid $900 for it. And we started       hanging out and playing the Bao game. Then some locals saw us       play and were watching and started to correct as were making       mistakes in rules and moves. So then I played with one of them       and the game lasted for ever, but I won. then they played       against each other and it lasted a lot less. Then I rolled one       and 3 of us went outside and smoked it.  Then I threw or better       flicked the  but in the wind and the wind caught it, and it       started accelerating more and going further, and the one guy said       [something]-colea! Which they didn't know how to explain, so I       insisted, and it turned out to be acceleration. So then I whipped       out that acceleration was the measure of gravity and stepped into       a whole new world of conversation: Up until now They didn't know       what acceleration, measure or gravity meant. So I started to       explain. Measure was easy, gravity a little less, but I think they       got it pretty well. I also explained to them that acceleration is       measure in m/s^2, and what that meant and they seemed to get it       pretty well. Then it was late and we went to bed. In the VIP       lounge with air conditioning and mattress on the floor.</p>
