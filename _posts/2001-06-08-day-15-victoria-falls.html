<p>We are now on the road for victoria falls . Microlight will be the activity I        want to check out. It seems like it should be fun, and interesting.</p>
<p>We arrived at this lodge. [Hey, K-dog, could you pass me something that has the        name of this lodge on it?] It's called Lokuthula lodges at Victoria Falls. I        hope I am excuesd for forgetting this name in the first place. The place is        marvelous. Beautiful and fantastic. Warthogs were grazing around here last        night, before sunset. there si a prch with furniture that is uneven, because        hanmade, yet stll very comfortable. The doors to the porch are actually strong        canvas with as tick on the bottom and there are ropes and pulleyssuch tha you        only have to pull this rope to open it. the ends are sealed with a strip of        wide velcro, and then locked with a strong zipper from the inside To open,        unzip, then pull on the string, which pulls the vlecroopen. It feels like you        are raising a flag or pulling up a sail.</p>
<p>Then we went to the Boma restaurant. My condition was noteworthy to describe.        The day started with the bus ride, basically. So after having packed the tent        we all lft with the bus, and I started drinkingafter I had herad that Manisha        had bought a flask of Ouzo. So I pured some in water, ina bottle and off we        wet. Then we stopped at a few artist's shags, were peple were buying local art        for dirt cheap. The socendstop was curious as I did not want to shop, and        actually did not wat to get off of the bu even because I was feeling very        sleepy. But thenI got off wih my shades, jacket and bottleof Ouzo. I didn't buy        anything, but people still wanted stuff, so I gave about 10 cigarettes away,        and I gave them the bottle of diluted Ouzo, since they wnated my "Water". Good,        I am hapy I made them happier without buying anything.</p>
<p>So then I made another Ouzo bottle from a water bottle. And the ride proceeded.        Whenarrived downtown Vic Falls, we went to a pizzzeria and ate, but they didn't        serve any alcohol, since the alcohol licenseis pretty hard to get like in the        states. In fact, just like in the states, you cannot have/carry/drink alcohol        in public areas. So I purchased a bottle of beer at te baracross, and was        drinking it iwth a smoke outside the restaurant/pizzeria, since Idid not want        to smoke inside. Then Aneesh came out and somebody that was suppsed to be the        olice or security guard, but was ot dresed like one, told us to go inside, and        we went inside the bar, and talkid to these 3 locals, who told us some        things,like that jobs arehard to get, the problems in Harare scare a lot of        people all over,thus diminushng tourism/jobs and about nitelife and such.</p>
<p>There was some tesion. I don't know what's going on but Windy seemed to keep on        talking to Aneesh in Indonesian when I walked back from the forward walking group        to tell Aneesh that Manny should get some more attention, as she is not feeling        better. Windy seemed not to care, by proceeding to talk in Indonesian as if I        was not there. I don't know if she was talking about Manny, or me or whatever.        Whatever. But Aneesh, in this little shopping center in the center of the city,        was able to score some small hunk of dark colored. At any rate, the point was        that I kept drinking also at the lunch table. The beer that is. Then we came to        this Lokuthula lodge. And did some more smoking. But this time we had the two        different kinds, the one from Zambia, from Aneesh, and the one from Main camp        in Hwange that I got from Louis. Plus we also tried the new stuff from Vic        Falls, and we kept drinking. And after that we went to the Boma, which is the        restaurant here at the lodge. So I was totally hazed. Big time. I mean really.        But then there was the boma. The restaurant. It is apparently a very famous        thing. First they serve you with the traditional drink in cup of metal with        enamel, that kind of cup that if it is chipped you do not want to use, as its        chppings (of the enamel) are toxic. But my cup was not chipped. Andthey pured        this whiteish concouxion in it which was about 2% alcoholic and tasted very        grainy and weird. [...]</p>
<p>Then it was open buffet. So I had some soup, and then warthog steak, some bore        sausage, and some other wild game animal kebab. The food was great, but I was        very hazed, and could not enjoy it too much. Then they put up a show too, these        kids were dancing and singing, and Manny said that she could probably dance        like that too.</p>
<p>Then we came back,actually me , Manny and Vijhung were walked back by a guard.        When we came back, then the others came back and Aneesh was saying that he was        going to smoke with Nits... I wonder how that went. I eventlually took an        aspirin that I got from Mariagrazia in Cleveland. And I put it in a glass,        which I thought was filled with water, but was instead filled with sprite and        gin. So I had the soluble aspirine with sprite, tonic water and gin. It was        interesting, but it worked. I went to bed, while the others started to play UNO        in Aneeshes bedroom.</p>
