<p><a href="http://antoniomagni.files.wordpress.com/2001/06/mani_elephants.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-214" title="Mani and Elephants from the Huge Truck" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2001/06/mani_elephants.jpg?w=300" alt="Mani and Elephants from the Huge Truck" width="300" height="200" /></a>I saw a crocodile today, actually 2,but they were swimming in the river, not        easy to see, and I did not see the whole body, just from the top of the water.        Here people work a lot harder to increase employment. They cut a huge hung of        wood with axes, like woodpeckers..</p>
<p>Today we are going to have lunch in this restaurant in the park I believe.</p>
