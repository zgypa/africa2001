<p>Wake up, as one of the first. Me and Mani decided to go for a       coffee at the reception area restaurant and Kamal eventually       joined us for what was a great experience. The restaurant had       something like three terraces, at three different levels. The       view was about 60km into the savanna onto a small pond.  One       could just sit there with binoculars and observe. Sureley one       would be able to see animals. So one ponders: Why drive around       like crazy on safaris when the same "one" can stay in a       restaurant, eating drinking and chilling and seeing the same       animals? One cannot answer the question as it was not just one       who went for a trip, but a number of people, namely 14. So it is       not upto the one to make the decisiions. And this was a true       fact.</p>
<p>At any rate, the restaurant, and view were fabulous. The whole       lodge, as I said is a dream. But after the breakfast, Mani       stopped by the gift shop and purchased a box containing 4 hand       made paper cards (that is the paper was hand made as well) just       like the paper Olga makes. I thougt they were very pretty and       bought one myself. Then I also bought a notebook made out of the       same paper. I thought I wanted to draw. yes, draw. I am writing       a lot, but I am not drawing, and while it is true that I have a       camera (my indistructable Canon Snappy 20) it is also true that       I do not have all the equipment to take the pictures I would       like to take. So drawing would be great. Then this idea evolved       to a better one, one which would let me have a goal: Why not       prepare this drawing notebook as a gift for my good friend and       artist Jeff Vincent? So that is what I decided to do. As soon as       the book is full, as soon as I run out of paper, I ship it to       Jeff. I know he will like it a lot .Then, when I get back to       Cleveland, I will scan it, and put the whole lot on my webpage,       along with these notes.</p>

I found this       white local who walked me to a little store space. It had a lady       in it, and a bar.. It was a kitchen, basically. He said I could       eat local food there. But it was too late, and the lady said       that she had finished all the food already. I was say, as that       looked pretty good to me. So I proceeded, and found myself       between a bunch of sculptres on wooden or concrete       pedistals. they were on a grass in display by 3 different       galleries. all of them really nice. With crazy prices, or at       least, crazy for there. But then again, you were paying for the       best of the local art. There was some Soma and some       contemporary. More contemporary, though. Soma I found more on       the streets. Then I had a sandwhich at this shag that said       something like "get-together". The lady who served me was       fabulous. She sold me aslo some tomato flavored chips, and a       Coke. While sitting there enjoying my drinking and drawing a       little fo this scene, i was approached by several men, the first       one who claimed to be a boy scout (he was in uniform) and was       asking me either for money or work. Since I was not alone, and       could not give him work, I gave him some money. Very little, but       it was the change I had in my pocket, and he seemed to       appreciate it. I signed a little piece of paper, which looked a       little shady, but not too much, and all was good. He was       nice,though. He was telling mehow they sometimes engage i       different projects like buying some chicken and then selling the       eggs, or like what they were doing now, which was collecting       some money for a camp where they would train young boy scouts to       do stuff.</p>
<p>We all met again to go downtown and do some shopping, and some       getting-used-to-africa activities, which included but did not       seclude, being able to deal with 5-6 people talking to you at       the same time, showing you art that is very similar from which       you have to choose from while at the same time not loosing your       temper. Not easy. But the curios (curious objects in the form of       curious shapes) they had were many. I turn a conrner and all I       see is stone statues on the ground. A huge field of       them. Hundreds, thousends of them. And behind them, a moltitude       of artists, brothers of artists, sisters of artists, friends       of... you get the picture. And as soon as you step in front of       their space they start. And this is the funny part! Only if you       get close to them they start. Then, as soon as you leave, the       leave you in peace. Then if you come back that way, no matter       how much you bought or didn't buy, they start all over       again. It's crazy, but among that moltitude of artists, there       are some that have really cool stuff. The question is, how am I       going to get this stuff to another continent? Stone is heavy. So       I didnt' buy any, thinking that I would be in the continent for       a while, so I might as well take it easy with shopping.</p>
<p>It was now time to go to the balloon, which was a tourist       attraction to get a better view of the falls. The balloon was       attached to a strong cable to a motor onthe ground and was       filled with helium mixed with air. It was pretty interesting to       see thetechnology and how they have done ti, but it was not too       great. You get to stand in a narrow octagonal corridorfor about       20 minutes as it goes up and down.</p>

Very touristy, and very       western. The food was amerinca style diner food. But after that,       some members of the group stayed at the kingdom and went to its       disco. I did not go, as I was really tired. I went back home       with Mani and Vijhung, which was getting very impatient getting       onthenerves of many members of the Vengans (this name was given       first to the bus, then to the whole group. I believe its origins       stem from some kind of cinematographic prodution, but I am not       certain of that). At one point, he decided he had enough and       told everyone he was going to leave and left. At which point, I       stood up, called him, he stopped, I showed him the keys to his       lodge and he stopped and came back. The evening ended with us       goig to bed, with my attempt to draw some constellations being       defeated by overcast, and with the rest of the gang coming back       from the disco drunk, tired, yet with the intention of staying       up all night, as we had to wake up at 5.30am the next day.</p>
