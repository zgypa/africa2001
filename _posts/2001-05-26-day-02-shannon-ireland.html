<p>I am happy to be in Europe.</p>
<p>I Landed, went through the passport check and customs, no problem. Then I tried        to call Molly, and I was always getting the London area code wrong, so I kept        on getting to this bank... Eventually she told me to come over in the        afternoon, that she told David she wouldn't go with him, I don't know where. So        I figured I needed money, and exchanged $100 (at the 1.481 rate), and then I        boarded the bus. All this took me 20mins. Once I get to Limmerick I will take a        bus to Dublin where I will arrive at 13:00.</p>
<p>Limmerick, I don't know much about it, but the bus station really. There is a        bar/pub which serves some irish beans, which I ordered with something to drink,        which I think was beer. I started to notice how the number of ladies is a lot        greater here than in any other places I have been to.</p>
