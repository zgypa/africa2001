<p>[caption id="attachment_230" align="alignright" width="300" caption="The way I thanked the cook, Ida, was kinda weird. I had a sentence ready to say. But I had forgotten about it, and Mani was pushing with time, she was pointing out that it was time to call the chef, since Aneesh was back, and I was sitting trying to remember what that sentece was, and I couldn&#39;t so eventually I just went. And it was bad, and I even didn&#39;t stand up, which I should have done. But it was not too bad. I will take a picture of it now. So I did and now I am back."]<a href="http://antoniomagni.files.wordpress.com/2001/06/safarilodge_small.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-230" title="Safari Lodge" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2001/06/safarilodge_small.jpg" alt="Safari Lodge" width="300" height="200" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Walking safari was a total failure, not because of the safari       per se being a failure, but because I was not part of it. I got       woken up via radio at the last minute, and people wouldn't reply       so I took my time and went from my tent to the meeting point,       but it was too late. Aneesh came to look for me, but he could       not even find my tent. So they all left. But the interesting       story is this: Yesterday Mani started feeling sick. We had       dinner. She had dinner. But it was a little hard an       painful. Fever was there, she felt it. She went to sleep, I got       my thermometer. Aneesh did not want me to take her       temperature. But all the others did. They were in the other       Bungalow (we had 3 bungalows, and one camp site) and they would       have measured the temperature if I would have not. So I went       into Mani's room. And she was sleeping deep, so deep that when I       took her temperature she did no even wake up. The thermometer       read 40°C, which is very high. The next morning it was down       to 38.5°C approx. But Aneesh yesterday night agreed that he       would wake up and not go to the safari to take care of Mani, but       as things turned out, he did go. The reason probably was that       Also Ravi felt sick, and Leena was sick already, although it was       her birthday. So Aparna stayed back to take care of       everyone. And I happened to be there too, so I helped too. Then       they all got back.</p>
<p>The afterenoon started. I went back to my tent to fix the 2       holes I found in it. I also tried to patch up the hole in the       therma-rest, that was caused by Kamal sitting on a papercutter and       hence snapping it. Then we did a night safari, which was very       cold, and kind of cool too. We saw 3 rhinos, white rhinos,       actually. And then more of the usual, like giraffes, but also       some african kangaroos, which are rabbits, I think, of some       sort, but they hop like kangaroos.</p>
<p>Ida Oieda was our cook at the safari lodge. She prepared a       gourmet dinner. It was really delicous. So I asked if we could       be introuduced to the chef, and we were. She came out, and after       Aneesh got back, I cordially thanked her for the delicous       dinner. I mean, it was the least thing I could do. The dinner was       great, the service was great, even better than the service I got       from really good high class restaurants in the rest of the       world, and definetely better service than in the USA. And the       whole meal for about 700 Zm$ which, at our exchange rate of       120Zm$/1USD, it comes out to be abuot 7USD. Just insanely       cheap. The rooms are a little more expensive, around 180USD/nite       and 280USD for the suites.</p>
