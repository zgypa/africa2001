<p>I decided to change campsite, as the Nairobi Park Services was too far away from        the city, and I had to get some stuff done. So I went with Oki and Smiley in        the morning downtown: Oki went for his Safari, to Masaai-Mara, and I got        dropped off at the backpackers hostel (       <a href="http://www.nairobibackpackers.com/"> www.nairobibackpackers.com </a> ), were Steve, the owner, is very cynical, but mainly sarcastic. This is one of        the main reasons why Oki does not like him. I think he is OK, and yes, very        sarcastic all the time, but not always, and there are moments were he is not.        Nonetheless, maybe Oki is right, not to trusts him.</p>
<p>This campsite is like 15 minutes walk from downtown, and 10 mins from the        Ethiopian embassy. Being finally Monday, I go in the morning to drop off my        passport and $70 at their embassy. Then I proceed for downtown with Martin, a        high school student from Sudan. He told me that in Sudan the situation is not        too good, but it is not too dangerous either. What I should watch out for is        the southern part, at the border: he strongly suggested me not to cross the        border Sudan/Ethiopia via Land. but to Fly into Khartoum from Addis Ababa instead.</p>
<p>Then he told me that if I want to go to Ethiopia, I need to go to Islee (which        then turned out to be Eastleigh) and take a truck there. And he asked if I        wanted to go there. I must remember that I as soon as I ran into him, just        outside the embassy, I told him I could not give him any money. and he said it        was all right. So he took me to the bus stop, we hopped on the bus, I paid the        $0.50 cents fair for both of us, and we went to Eastleigh. This is a dodgy        Ethiopian neighbourhood, but after some asking, we finally found out that I can        leave for Moyale from there by showing up around noon and hopping on a truck:        1000Ksh to sit in the cabin, and Ksh500 to sit on the truck with the        cargo.Then we came back to downtown, and had lunch, and then he had to go back        to school, since he only was allowed to skip school in the morning to go get        his passport stuff done.</p>
<p>So I concluded my Nairobi dive by going to an internet cafe', installing        winzip, teraterm and ttssh, and doing all my stuff. www.brillig.org is still        down. I don't know what is happening. Also acd told me in an old email that I        had yet not read that he had still not received my money, which kind of worries        me.</p>
<p>Then I went to this other place,, were Martin took me earlier, for        international calls: they only charge 100Ksh/min istead of 200. So I went there        around 3pm and called Jeff at 7912657. But being there an 8 hours difference, it        was about 7am for him, and nobody picked up the phone. I left a message. This        was kind of disappointing since I was expecting him to be home, or at least to        pick up the phone.</p>
<p>Whatever. I walked back to the hostel, where I met three girls, that had just        finished a tour from Cape town: one from GB, and two from Australia, that were        going to GB to work or study. A fourth girl was being very asocial and reading        her book i a corner.</p>
<p>Then it was dinner time, and as I was eating the fried fish with chips with one        of the girls, I saw two guys go in the back with backpacks: they turned out to bo Yaron        and Yani, the Israeli brothers. They took showers, then, as I was just done        eating, they were going down the street to this place called Buffalo Bill's to        have something to eat and they asked me if I wanted to go. I had to finish my        beer, so I did, and then we went. They had something to eat, and I had a shot of        whisky, which was supposed to cost like Ksh250 but the waiter screwed up and        gave me 2 shots, without me knowing it. So when the bill came, it was a problem,        because I had already drunken the whisky, and I didn't want to pay for Ksh500.        but at the end I paid 350, and he was going to put the other 150. I think I did        the right thing: After all I did drink two shots, and he should pay something,        or rather most of the extra shot, since it was him who screwed up by telling me        that the whisky would have been 250. So this way, I paid a little and he paid        most of it, as to pay for his mistake. And I got two shots for a better price        this way.</p>
<p>Then the Israeli brothers, went to change some money at the hotel next door, and        we came back at Buffalo Bill's bar, called the horseshoe bar, to play some pool.        As it turned out, the bar was a whore bar, and the pool table had a waiting        list of 13 people. So we hung out there for a little bit, I got some attention        from some ladies, and then we all left. Actually, a funny anecdote happened:        as we signed up for pool, we were standing just by it, and didn't realize that        we were actually obstructing the view of the pool table to a man dressed up in        a suite. So the man told Yaron: "What makes you think that I actually want you        to stand there?" And the girl with him agreed. I was like "Wooohhha" In my mind        and headed towards the door where I hung out with the door man for a while and        told him about the arrogance of the man in the suite. he knew the man, and he        pointed out that he has problems: men who are always alone (and in fact he was        alone, just with the girl) must have problems. So I went back in and enjoyed        the crowd and the beautiful ladies wanting to give me massages. I refused: it        would be too much for the first night, and plus I had company waiting outside.</p>
<p>So we came back, and that's when Yaron and Yaniv actually put their        credibility/reliability to a strong test: When we came back, Steve was doing some        accountancy work on the computer and was already tired and ready to go to sleep.        The two brothers approached him asking him where they could buy some wooden        carving curios. So Steve started to show them s few places on the map. And since        this was taking a long time, I went outside to look at the stars and smoke a        little. When I left, Steve had told them about two places and showed them how to        get their with a map. When I came back, the brothers were still there, but this        time Steve had showed them more places, and had also revolutionized the way he        was giving directions: he whipped out some postcards of Nairobi and was showing        them where the shops were on the postcards! Eventually Steve got fed up and        "come on guys, let me finish up here". As a matter of fact, they were able to        have Steve procrastinate fora good 45 minutes while tired. When they came into        my room, I told them "Banita, banita!", as they built upon their        credibility/reliability level.</p>
