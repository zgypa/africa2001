<p>Something but not much happened in the past days. I have not     written any entries, simply because life was pretty much normal. I     was staying at this house, the Mathur's mansion, and all went     well. Not too often did we leave the "royal" walls.</p>
<p>What I did do of interest was get to know Harrington, the night     time security guard of the house. And in doing so, I also drew     him.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_254" align="alignright" width="292" caption="Harrington is a nice fellow. He was working as a security guard, but wanted to go to university. He didn&#39;t have much dough, though, and could not afford to. We talked and talked, and had a great time, but when we hit religion, unfortunately, there was nothing to do. Harrington is very religous and believes in God and Christ in an almost fanatic way. The people here are brought up that way, and there is not much one can do. Their view of the earth, life and big-bang is totally biblical: &quot;There once was Adam and Eve...&quot;.

<p>[caption id="attachment_253" align="alignleft" width="295" caption="The Kite is a very obvious constellation that rotates around the sky at nite, and one can see it pretty much everywhere across the southern hemisphere. I have heard that it can be seen in the Northern one too, at some points of the year, if you are closer to the equator. It seems to creep up there at times... The other constellation, the Caterpillar, was the one that Aneesh found. And he also wrote a poem for this beautiful night sitting outside, watching stars in Zambia.

<p>Another activity of these days was an attempt to sketch some     constellations in the sky. I had this goal of giving names to all     the constellations, since I couldn't find anyone who knew them     already, or who could tell me how this southern sky was. So i came     up with one that I had been looking at for the past couple of days     already, and Aneesh came up with an even more complex one. He is     good. I would have never seen that one.</p>
<p>Aneesh and Mani decided to give me a ride to New Kapiri-Mposhi,       which is where the Tanzania-Zambia Railway station is. This       railway was built buy the Chinese in 1977, and they still use       the same trains. His mother came along too. Before leaving       Lusaka, I had to purchase the train ticket, since, the day       before, when I got to the office, at about 15:45, they were       already closed. When I got there, at abut 9:15, the man said       pointing at the watch: "Didn't we agree that you would come at       8:30? You are not going to make to Kapiri! The train leaves at       12.30!" "I'm driving" I replied firmly. "How much for a first       class ticket?"  "That's not what we agreed on!". He was       referring to the conversation we had the previous day, where I       was merely asking questions. Eventually he stuck his hand out       from under the window and waited. "What?" I asked. "Student ID"       he said. I gave him that. He looked at it, put it back on the       counter where he found it, then stuck his hand out       again. "What?" I asked. "Money" he said. "How much?" "Oh, right,       K85,000", which is about $25 for a 1800km stretch. I was       realizing that I was not responding well to his arrogant       behavior. I was trying to be arrogant back, but then in this       case it was pretty pointless, because it would mean loosing. If       I wouldn't have bought the ticket there, I would have just made       my life harder.</p>
<p>I took the ticket and jumped in the car. Then a boy called me,       so I rolled down the window and he gave me 3 envelopes he said I       should deliver to the TAZARA train statin master, as a favor. I       was puzzled and wondered how they could trust a random dude, but       then I realized that failing to deliver the letters would have       been silly. I had no intention not to deliver them. Actually, I       kinda got a kick out of having a mission. But I was wondering       "what if somebody just says yeah, yeah, and then tosses them out       the window?" In such a case I guess the TAZARA dude would not       trust tourists anymore. But maybe such thing never happened,       which would explain why he would trust me. Maybe all the       tourists are behaving relatively well, and that is why I am       having a relatively easy time getting around....</p>
<p>It's a 2 hour drive from Lusaka to Kapiri, and it went pretty       smooth. Once we got there, we checked the train station out. It       was pretty shady, but not the station itself as much as the       people in it. Eventually I said bye to Aneesh, his mum and Mani,       and proceeded toward the train which was already 1 hour late at       this point. A somebody waved at me, indicating to go to a box       office titled "immigration". Now, what the hell is immigration       doing here, that we are about 800km away from the border? Well,       I haven't figured out the answer to that one yet. At any rate,       he told me to show him my passport, so I did. And he soon found       out that I was illegal.</p>
<p>That is right. Illegal I was. The dude at the Zimbabwe-Zambian       border stamped me with a "VID" which apparently standed for       "V1D", which ment "Visa one day", and this was on the 10th of       June. Now, today was the 15th, so I was obviously illegal. Of       course they knew what had happened and took advantage of the       situation. I had to bribe them. I knew exactly what to do, I       just didn't know how flexible they would have been. And as it       turns out I could have bargained with them just the same way one       bargains at the market. They asked for 400,000.  I should have       said I only had 50,000. They would have said it was no good,       then I would have said, OK, I can give you my emergency money       too, but then I am only left with $50, so here is 100,000. But       it didn't go that way.</p>
<p>The main problem was that I had 200,000 in my innerjacket pocket       and 50,000 in the front pocket of my trousers. So had I said I       only have 100,000, and then stick the hand in my pocket and       start counting only 50,000 would have been tricky, and I didn't       feel confident enough to do this. At any rate, 250,000 later,       they stamped me again, backdated to the 11th of June, with a       "V7D". And, since it is always the last stamp that counts, I was       now legal again.</p>
<p>It is funny how thin the line between being legal and being       illegal is. I often think about it.</p>
<p>But at the end I, now legal, walked towards the main hall of the station,        where the mass of people was standing and waiting. Then the gates opened and        the crowd started to push forward. I was watching all from a little area, which        was kind of like a porch, a few steps elevated from the main hall. I later        found out that this was the 1st class waiting area. From there I assisted some        cop guy severely beat another guy for what I dont know, because I missed. But        this violent action caused the crowd to rush even faster thgrough the now free gates.</p>
<p>A guy standing next to me, Clement, told me that those were the 3rd class peple        and reassured me that there would be no violence in the train (I asked him, as        a matter of fact).</p>
<p>Once boarded I found my seat to be in the second couch and I was sitting with        two businessmen from Congo, and a TAZARA dude, who was not on duty. He was        very very nice and friendly and smart. He knew a lot, while the Congonians, they        were more on the silent side, but very nice and respectful. I slept in the        upstairs bed.</p>
