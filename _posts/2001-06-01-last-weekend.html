<address>A story by Elie Gurarie</address>
<h2>Preamble</h2>
<div class="email">
<p>the following letter was written by my friend adrian and<br />
myself to the super-snide hyper-hip Seattle weekly "The<br />
Stranger" in hopes of publication in the I, Anonymous column.<br />
The I, Anonymous column is designed to let people communicate<br />
deep thoughts and feelings to people they have no other means<br />
of communication with.  Typical "I Anonymouses" are: a)<br />
unnecessarily angry rants by<br />
busdrivers/waiters/taxidrivers/bankclerks against<br />
disrespectful customers with a lot of "fuck"s and "asshole"s<br />
and "cumwipe"s, b) unnecessarily vivid rants by sillily jilted<br />
older women/younger women/younger men/older men dumped by<br />
bisexual egoists full of "fucker"s and "asswipe"s and<br />
"cumhole"s, or c) unnecessarily explicit sexual fantasies by<br />
lascivious would-be lovers towards strangers glimpsed<br />
furtively on the streets full of etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>we thought we would try to send The Stranger the following<br />
heartfelt apology to an anonymous victim of a giddy weekend.</p>
<p>they didn't print it.</p>
<p>oh well.</p>
<p>anyways, the attached letter is more to tell the story of last<br />
weekend than to waste type on The Stranger.</p>
<p>i hope you enjoy it and are all lusty and well and planning to<br />
visit me soon.</p>
<p>love,</p>
<p>elie</p>

<h2>Letter</h2>
<div class="letter">
<p>Dear Mr. Photographer with Glasses (we think) and Blue Shirt<br />
(we think) Innocently Protruding from the Masses on the Corner<br />
of Fremont and Leary during the Solstice Parade only to be<br />
Sliced (oh how we know!) by the Tin Pincers on a Poorly<br />
Controlled and only Slightly Better Constructed Tandem Bike<br />
Junk Lobster Float,</p>
<p>We are Sorry.  We are very very sorry we sliced your shirt and<br />
we only hope your skin is intact.  Though excuses are moot, I<br />
trust you will bear through the Apology.</p>
<p>We are mere Midwestern Slackjaws, accustomed as it were to the<br />
vast skies and open fields so welcoming to the mettalically<br />
belabored bycicle contraption.  We arrived, as it were, only<br />
recently into this Hub of Sophistication and Dizzying<br />
Metropolitan Splendor.  It was only at High Noon on Friday,<br />
the Fifteenth of the Fair Month of June, that the Rumor<br />
bespotted us that a Fair was to be had, that a Parade was to<br />
be processioned, and that in their Bottomless Generosity and<br />
reflecting only the Welcoming Spirit of the City, Strangers,<br />
as it were, would be welcomed into the Festivities. So, with<br />
Humble Hearts and Hopeful Spirits, we threw ourselves into a<br />
manic flurry of Slicings and Weldings and Screwings and<br />
Nuttings and Boltings and sundy Jerryriggings as two bycicly<br />
frames, lustilly looted from our stalwart Provider, the City<br />
Dump, gradually took upon itself the form of a Crustacean in<br />
an oh so nobly intentioned Tribute to the Ocean, whose<br />
Splendour had only a Fortnight earlier benumbed us.  By Eleven<br />
O'Clock on the following day, yea, on the very Sixteenth of<br />
June, the creature was Antennaed and Functionally Pincered and<br />
Belegged and Betailed and Primped and Primed and only too<br />
eager to make its Appearance on the Great Stage of the<br />
Solstice Parade and the yet Greater Stage of our Host City^Ã’s<br />
Heart, as it were.</p>
<p>And yet, we are no longer the springy sprightly summer calves<br />
bounding on the alfalfa fields of our homesteads.  Nay!<br />
Neither the Endorphinations of Sleeplessness nor the<br />
Invigorations of Caffeine nor even the Giddiness of the<br />
Adventure we had Embiked upon could sustain our ever lapsing<br />
Faculties of Sanity and Balance and Control.  And so, as the<br />
Vast Crowds and Gawking Eyes and Drum-beating Salmon Coffins<br />
and Calypso Playing Marching Bands and Mezmerizing Marionettes<br />
blended with the Sultry Haze of a Soltice Sun into a great<br />
Dizzying Kaleidoscope of Synesthetic Cacophony, and as our<br />
Muscular Strength waned and as the Crowds tightened their grip<br />
at the very rightward jog of the Procession through downtown<br />
Fremont.... well, perhaps the sudden slip on the handlebar,<br />
the quick lefthandeed sinusoid of an increasingly crankier<br />
crustacean, the unexpected gasping swipe through your shirt,<br />
dear stranger, can be, if not forgiven, at least conceived of<br />
in the context of our Enthusiasm.</p>
<p>lovingly yours,</p>
<p>Anonymous</p>
