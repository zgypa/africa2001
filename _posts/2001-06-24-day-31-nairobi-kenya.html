<p>Tomorrow Oki is going to Masai-Mara national park for free, instead of paying        $50/day plus $17/day park fees, which totals $280. I was thinking of going with        him, but I think I should not. Just a few hours ago I was thinking while taking        a dump that I don't want to leave this country with the impression that I have        seen it and don't want to come back. I just want to get that "oh, yes, I've        travelled through Africa, but didn't see much. yes I met some people, but I        would be glad to go again and cover more interesting places". I would like to        come back with Mec and Jeff...</p>
<p>So today was pretty boring: just sitting around at the camp doing little, like        playing carrom and pool. Night finally came and it was time to eat. They were        showing James Bond The world is not enough on TV. Pretty nice. Then, all of a        sudden, Smiley noticed some blood on the floor: it was one of the dogs, Fire,        who was bleeding from her leg. So Brandon, the owner, was promptly called, but        he was having dinner and did not want to be disturbed. There was a lot of        tension now at the camp site. People didn't like the way Brandon just didn't        come back to take care of the problem.</p>
<p>One lady tried to medicate the wound by wrapping it with some medical gauze,        but she didn't tie it tight enough, so she didn't stop the bleeding at all.        Fortunately, at the same time, another man wa trying to find some vet and        succeeded. Fire was taken to the vet and the vet said that 1 artery and 2 veins        were cut by probably some form of knife. At this point, when the bar lady        translated these words from Swahili to English, the camp site entered alarm        mode: somebody is trying to break in and is damaging/hurting the dogs. So the        guards armed themselves with their strong, and dangerous bow and arrow, and        went around the site to check if somebody was there. But they didnt' find        anybody. In the meanwhile, James Bond continued on the screen and eventually        finished. I was kind of scared that if someone was breaking in, I might be the        one to suffer the most since I was the only tent pitched on the lawn. And the        lady barlady was telling me not to say these hings, that it's just silly. So then        I asked why she looked worried, and she said that if they break in she might        very well be the first one to go, since they will want to come inside and        raid the office. So I laughed and recognized this behaviour as a characteristic        female one. and asked her about it, but she just laughed and said nothing.</p>
<p>I finally decided to have the last beer and go to bed, when The perfect Murder        came on. So I watched a little of it, but it was too Hollywood, so I finally        decided to go to bed. At this time, Oki was developing a new theory about the        cut leg: Since there are no blood traces on the floor outside, maybe she got        hurt inside with something sharp. This would eliminate the break in danger        which, they thought, was threatening them. I slept in the tent and all went        all right.</p>
