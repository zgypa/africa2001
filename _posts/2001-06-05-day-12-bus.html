<p>We are now on the bus heading towards Zimbabwe with a stop in Livingstone.        Yesterday, the six hour safari. It was very good, and we had that good tour        guide, Stan, that the other group was talking so well about. He was good, as a        matter of fact. We didn't get to see all the cool things they saw the day        before yesterday, but it was very good.</p>
<p>I decided to go camping in the national park on our next stop. Being inside        life so much is good. I will need some advice, but I think it should be all        right. There is lots of life here. If somebody ever felt like they wanted to        live, they should come here and camp in the private camping, the one with no        facilities, just space. You can come here, and live with other animals. All of        them. All together.</p>
<p>After we got back from the six hour safari, we decided to cook the chicken, so        we build a grill from scrap metal they had at the construction site near by (or        actually we were trying to build it, but we then all decided it will be best if        we let Chama, our driver, do it, since he was not letting go of the task. He        had to do it, so it was good he did it. we cooked and all was all right.</p>
<p>After all the eating was over, a hippo was the main attraction. It was grazing        under a spotlight in front of the restrooms. Everyone was enjoying its presence        and making and taking pictures. Some people, like Aparna, more concerned than other.</p>
<p>Then I started rolling and Vijhung came by. This was all because he was        sleeping upstairs of the Belle, that is the boat house, which turned out to be        The original Belle boat, used to bring tourists around the Chobe river in the        60's. Now, also Kamal was sleeping upstairs, and he decided to lock everybody I        the room, as they were sleeping, which gave him a lot of power. So Vijhung was        probably or felt probably responsableand came down to make sure all was all        right. The Kamal went to bed, Vijhung followed and so did I. Or so I thought.        It was rough. At least the beginning was. First very loud Snoring from above        and below. Then the sleeping bag was backwards, or I was backwards. Then I        finally fell asleep, but I soon woke up for peeing. Outside was creepy. I felt        like there were lots of creatures watching me. I thing there was one hyppo just        infrot of the Belle (or the Titanic, as Charma lilkes to call it) and a few on        the other side of the bridge.</p>
<p>Now we did the border which was a trip. First we went to the Botswana-Zambia        border to get nto Zimbabwe, becuase on the way int the immigration guy told        Aneesh that he had to bring the customs forms back to that border. He was a        little confused but did it. Thenit turned out that after we all got our        passports stamped, we needed to go to the other border, the Botswana-Zimbabwe        one. Which overall makes more sense. So we did the the first Botswana border,        then the second Botswana border and finally the Zimbabwe border. I paid 30USD        for my single entry tourist VISA.</p>

<p>I wish there were more monkeys in north america. because they are alwaus        putting on a show. monnkeying around evolution is not wrong: they act like us,        and wanna do all what we wanna do. (Mani)</p>
