<p>I am coming to the conclusion that the people here are used to working their        asses off. They could come to america and work 3 jobs easy. And they are used        to doing it for their whole lives, then reaching age of retirement without a        penny, or actually with some money, but nothing close to western money. Some        people work all the time, and still after 30-40 years of working they cannot        even afford 100USD.</p>
<p>I picked up my passport VISA and went to see if I could get a VISA for Sudan. I        talked to Mike, and he told me that he came through Sudan no problem. . He is        actually from Romania, and has spent the last 4 years on the road, 2 years in        Egypt some month in Turkey, and now a few month in Nairobi. He uses the internet        to travel: he designs webpages, and since now there is internet everywhere,        when he runs out of money, he makes sure he ends up in a big city, then goes to        see if there is somebody who wants a webpage, by showing them the pages he has        done so far. And since he is pretty good, he always gets a job. Then, he        leaves again . But now he has to go back home for Christmas. And then he will        go again, travel.</p>
<p>At any rate, he told me to go through Sudan, that there is no problem. The only        problem is the VISA. It takes at least 3 days and 4 photos, with letter of        reccomdation from your own embassy. I tried to get it in Nairobi, but they        told me that they only issue business VISAs. Then, as I was walking down the        stairs o leave, I remembered never to assume anything, so I went back upstairs        to bthe Sudan embassy lady, and asked her if it was possible at all to get a        tourist visa, and she told me to try in Addis Ababa, as they might issue them there.</p>
<p>Then, when I came home that night, I talked to Mike about it, and we was very        surprised: He said that that was very funny since they issued a VISA to a guy        from Holland about a few weeks ago. Then I told Mike that the lady at the        embassy also told me that they had not been issuing tourist visas since        january first and that I had not told her my nationality until after she told        me that they don't issue VISAs for tourism. Maybe she recognized my accent        as being from America?</p>
<p>The evening was a lazy one. After a chicken dinner at the hostel, and after        playing around with Mike to try to get the scanner to work, I went to bed ,        already thinking to leave the next morning.</p>
